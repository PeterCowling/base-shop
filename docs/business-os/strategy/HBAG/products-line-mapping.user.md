# PRODUCTS-01 — Caryina Product Line Mapping

## 1. Product Family Summary

Caryina is a premium artisan micro-bag accessory brand. All products share a single physical architecture — the "Mini Facade Micro Bag" — a structured micro handbag-shaped object with turn-lock clasp, dual top handles, and side gussets. Products are differentiated by **function** (what it attaches to / holds) and **colorway** (exterior material, texture, and facade treatment).

| Code | Product | Function | Price Hypothesis | Status | Launch Priority |
|------|---------|----------|-----------------|--------|----------------|
| H1 | Bag Charm | Clips to handbag strap as fashion accessory | €89 | Active — physical exists, listing prep | **1 (launch SKU)** |
| H2 | AirPods Holder | Holds AirPods Pro / AirPods 4 with clip attachment | €119 | Active — fit confirmed (TASK-03) | **2 (launch SKU)** |
| H3 | Amalfi Location Variant | H1 body with Amalfi Coast imagery; in-destination seasonal | TBD | Deferred — supplier graphic capability unconfirmed | 3 (seasonal Jun–Sep) |
| H4 | Dog Poop Bag Holder | H1 body with leash clip; holds waste bags | TBD | Deferred — post-checkpoint | 4 |
| H5 | Children's First Bag | Standalone mini bag for ages 6–10 | TBD | Deferred — requires GPSR + REACH compliance (~€1–3K) | 5 |

## 2. Colorway Variants (from PRODUCT-01)

Three physical variants identified from product photography. All share the master architecture.

| Variant | Base Colorway | Exterior Texture | Facade Applique | Bottom Strip | Edge/Binding | Hardware Finish |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| V1 | Silver (metallic) | Reptile-scale emboss | Present — taupe/khaki frames, silver/grey awnings | Grey | Grey | Gold-tone |
| V2 | White w/ pink splatter | Croc-style emboss | **Unknown** (front not photographed) | Not clearly separated | White | Gold-tone |
| V3 | Peach / salmon | Pebbled grain | Present — cream frames, orange awnings | Green | Peach | Mixed silver/gold (**needs confirmation**) |

## 3. SKU Matrix

Crossing function (H-codes) × colorway (V-codes) produces the full potential SKU set. Only cells marked **Launch** are in scope for the Etsy demand test.

| SKU | Function | Colorway | Launch Status | Notes |
|-----|----------|----------|--------------|-------|
| H1-V1 | Bag Charm | Silver metallic | **Launch** | Lead hero SKU — metallic finish + facade = highest visual differentiation |
| H1-V2 | Bag Charm | White/pink splatter | **Launch** | Playful colourway; facade presence TBC |
| H1-V3 | Bag Charm | Peach/salmon | **Launch** | Warm neutral; facade present; hardware finish needs confirmation |
| H2-V1 | AirPods Holder | Silver metallic | **Launch** | Tech-functional framing at €119; same body as H1-V1 |
| H2-V2 | AirPods Holder | White/pink splatter | **Launch** | — |
| H2-V3 | AirPods Holder | Peach/salmon | **Launch** | — |
| H3-* | Amalfi Location | TBD | Deferred | Requires supplier graphic capability confirmation |
| H4-* | Dog Poop Holder | TBD | Deferred | Post-checkpoint |
| H5-* | Children's Bag | TBD | Deferred | GPSR + REACH gate |

**Launch SKU count: 6** (3 colorways × 2 functions)

## 4. Positioning Map

### By function

| | Bag Charm (H1) | AirPods Holder (H2) |
|---|---|---|
| **Price** | €89 | €119 |
| **Positioning frame** | Fashion accessory — "one considered charm that elevates the bag" | Fashion-tech hybrid — "your AirPods deserve a bag, not a case" |
| **Primary differentiator vs Etsy field** | Handbag silhouette at artisan tier (competitors cluster <$30 for shape charms or >$300 for luxury brands) | Reframes tech case as bag jewellery (Etsy leather AirPods cases = 3,000+ items, mostly <$50 commodity) |
| **Price anchor** | Coach bag charm at €95; Caryina at €89 is "obvious yes" tier | Hermes AirPods case at $930 proves premium buyer exists; €119 = accessible luxury alternative |
| **Key purchase trigger** | Visible craft: structured shape, turn-lock hardware, Italian origin story | Same craft cues + tech utility; fits current AirPods Pro and AirPods 4 |
| **Primary ICP** | Fashion-aware women 27–42 with aspirational handbags | Same ICP + gift buyers (functional + fashionable = strong gift logic) |

### By colorway positioning

| Colorway | Mood | Best-Fit Context | Photography Direction |
|----------|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| V1 — Silver metallic | Bold, evening, statement | Night out / special occasion styling; hero product photos | High-contrast; dark stone or marble backgrounds |
| V2 — White/pink | Playful, feminine, spring | Spring/summer; gift-appeal; younger end of ICP range | Soft daylight; blush/cream linen backgrounds |
| V3 — Peach/salmon | Warm, everyday elegance | Daily carry; Amalfi aesthetic; broadest appeal | Golden-hour warmth; terracotta or wood backgrounds |

## 5. Differentiation Notes

### vs. Etsy bag charm field (MARKET-01 findings)

| Competitor Pattern | Caryina's Wedge |
|---|---|
| Mini handbag-shaped charms on Etsy cluster <$30 — cheap materials, no hardware story | Structured silhouette with real turn-lock hardware and visible stitching reads as a different product category |
| Premium €80–€150 space on Etsy = bag jewellery (pearl chains) and leather tech cases — not handbag-silhouette charms | Caryina occupies a genuine white space: handbag-shaped + artisan-tier price |
| Buyers warn about AliExpress resellers in Etsy charm search (Reddit) | Italian design origin + craft photography = trust signal that resellers cannot replicate |
| AirPods cases on Etsy are commodity (3,000+ items, mostly <$50) | H2 at €119 reframes from "tech case" to "bag accessory that holds AirPods" — different purchase psychology |

### vs. luxury brands

| Luxury Competitor | Caryina's Position |
|---|---|
| Hermes/Chanel AirPods cases ($930–$950) | Same "fashion object" frame at 8× lower price; no brand equity yet, but craft + origin story compensates |
| Coach bag charm (~€95) | Direct price competitor; Coach has brand but mass-market distribution — Caryina has artisan scarcity and Italian provenance |
| Fendi / Dior bag charms (€300–€800) | Aspirational reference set; Caryina is the "entry to considered accessories" for buyers who want craft without logo tax |

## 6. Open Items and Unknowns

| Item | Priority | Impact | Owner |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| V2 front panel photo needed — facade presence unknown | P1 | SKU definition: V2 may be "plain" variant (no facade) which changes its positioning | Pete |
| V3 hardware finish confirmation (silver/gold mix vs reflection artefact) | P1 | QC spec and listing accuracy | Pete |
| Charm attachment hardware (clip/carabiner/keyring) not shown in any photos | P0 | Functional requirement for H1 — cannot list as "bag charm" without visible attachment method | Pete |
| Unit cost and MOQ from supplier (TASK-02) | P0 | Margin stack for all 6 launch SKUs; €89/€119 pricing depends on ~€35 COGS target | Pete |
| Photography perception test (TASK-06 VC-01) | P0 | Gate before any listing goes live — ≥3/5 cold reviewers must estimate ≥€80 for H1 lead photo | Pete |
| Interior construction and lining details | P1 | BOM accuracy, compliance documentation, listing claims | Pete |
| Scarf/strap accessory pack-out decision | P2 | If included: adds perceived value and unboxing moment; if not: simplifies BOM | Pete |

## 7. Caryina Mini Facade Micro Bag launch research

### Market reality for micro‑bag charms and AirPods holders

The fastest way to frame the launch SKU prices (€89 bag charm; €119 AirPods holder) is to anchor them against what shoppers are actually seeing when they browse comparable terms on Etsy. On Etsy, the broad "Bag Charms", "Mini Bag Charms", and "Airpods Case" market pages each show "5,000+ items", signalling an extremely crowded search environment where buyers are conditioned to rapid comparison and low-friction substitution.

Within those saturated result sets, the dominant price cues for handbag-shaped mini accessories skew low. For example, in the "Mini Bag Charms" browse page, a representative listing is explicitly a "mini purse bag charm … faux leather … tiny purse airpod case", priced around $11 (sale).
 This matters because it demonstrates that (a) the "tiny handbag" silhouette is already legible to Etsy shoppers as a low-cost novelty category and (b) some competitor listings explicitly tie the silhouette to the AirPods use-case at budget price points.

For AirPods holders specifically, an Etsy browse page scoped to "Leather Airpod Case Keychain" shows "888+ items," with many visible price points clustering below ~$40.
 A concrete example from a single listing: an "Italian leather keychain" AirPods case is priced at €25.62+, with model-specific pricing such as €28.40 for AirPods Pro variants; the listing also emphasises "keychain" attachment and personalisation as standard expectations.

A key structural takeaway is that Etsy's broad market pages blend physical products with digital patterns and templates (often €1–€6). For "Mini Bag Charms", "Airpods Case", and "Leather Airpod Case Keychain," Etsy explicitly offers an "Exclude digital items" filter, a hint that buyers entering from search can be exposed to a wide price band where ultra-low digital products compress perceived value.

### Competitive benchmarks and price anchoring

The most defensible pricing argument for a premium micro-bag accessory on Etsy is to show that the concept is already validated in premium fashion—just not typically in Etsy's mid-market presentation layer.

A price ladder that reflects what's available today:

Affordable premium brand anchor: Coach's bag charm range on its EU site includes multiple bag charms priced from roughly €50 up to €225, with specific bag charms at €95 (for example, "Cassette Bag Charm" and "Cherry Heritage Leather Bag Charm").
Luxury-tech anchor: Hermes currently lists an "AirPods Pro case" in Swift calfskin with a carabiner hook at $1,625, and another colourway listed at $1,125.
Luxury "mini bag as charm" precedent (closest analogue to Caryina's architecture): Fendi sells nano-bag charms that explicitly function as attachable micro-bags (snap hook to attach as a charm), and explicitly states capacity for "headphones, keys, or lipstick."
 Its "Nano Baguette Charm" appears at €670 for a nappa leather version and €1,900 for an embellished satin version; within its bag charm/accessory category, visible charm and strap accessories range into the €290–€980 territory.
Luxury brand signalling mechanics: Dior positions bag charms as "precious fetishes" that make accessories unique, and maintains a dedicated "Key Rings and Bag Charms" category with seasonal references (e.g., Spring–Summer 2026).
This benchmark set has two direct implications for Caryina's €89/€119 hypotheses.

First, €89 is not an arbitrary number; it deliberately undercuts a recognisable accessible-premium anchor (€95) while remaining dramatically below luxury bag charm economics (hundreds to thousands).

Second, the AirPods holder at €119 becomes legible as an "accessible luxury" bid only if the product presentation makes shoppers categorise it as bag jewellery / crafted object, not "an AirPods case." That "mini bag that holds headphones" framing is explicitly used by a top luxury player, which strengthens the conceptual validity of the positioning—but also means the product must look like it belongs in that category (structure, closure, hardware, finish).

### Demand signals and buyer psychology

The "bag charms are back" thesis is not speculative: it has been repeatedly documented as a contemporary personalisation behaviour, tied to social media visibility and "customisation" aesthetics.

A 2024 Vogue analysis of TikTok culture described bag charms as a standout "top-trending product," explicitly linking the rise to a wider "chaotic customisation" impulse and reporting that the #BagCharms hashtag had amassed 21,700 posts at the time of publication.
 This supports the idea that H1 (bag charm) can ride a durable styling behaviour rather than relying solely on utilitarian demand.

From the marketplace side, Etsy itself curates "trending bag charms" themed browse experiences (example: "Trending Bag Charms 2025" style pages), signalling that the platform recognises bag charms as a repeatable gifting and style motif within its discovery layer.

For H2 (AirPods holder), demand is governed by a different purchase logic: compatibility assurance + everyday carry convenience. That logic is strengthened when the compatible device is current and clearly specified. Official Apple technical specifications give the charging-case dimensions that matter for internal fit claims:

AirPods Pro 2 MagSafe charging case: 45.2 mm (H) × 60.6 mm (W) × 21.7 mm (D).
AirPods 4 charging case: 46.2 mm (H) × 50.1 mm (W) × 21.2 mm (D).
Because AirPods 4 was introduced in Apple's own newsroom communications in September 2024, it is now a mainstream model with an installed base large enough to justify explicit "AirPods 4" callouts in listings.
 The underlying implication for Caryina's H2 listings is that "fits AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4" should be treated as a primary conversion driver, not a footnote, because Etsy buyers are trained by commodity listings to scan for model coverage first and aesthetics second.

### Platform and compliance constraints for an Italy-based launch

The compliance picture has two layers: EU product law (for items shipped into the EU) and Etsy's platform requirements (for what you claim and how you present it).

At EU level, the General Product Safety Regulation (GPSR), Regulation (EU) 2023/988, applies from 13 December 2024, replacing and modernising the earlier general product safety framework and explicitly covering distance/online selling contexts.
 For micro accessories with metal hardware and small detachable components, the practical GPSR impact is less about a single "certification" and more about being able to evidence a product safety process: risk assessment, documentation, traceability and corrective action readiness (especially if marketing to or used by children).

At chemicals level, REACH obligations can apply to "articles" such as leather and coated fabrics. The European Chemicals Agency explains that suppliers of articles must communicate sufficient information to allow safe use when an SVHC is present above threshold, and consumers can request SVHC information from suppliers, who must provide it within 45 days.
 This interacts directly with your deferred H5 consideration: a child-positioned product does not just increase safety scrutiny; it tends to increase the expectation that you have traceable materials documentation ready to answer substance and safety questions quickly.

At platform level, Etsy's Seller Policy states that sellers are responsible for complying with applicable laws and regulations for products listed, including required labels and warnings.
 Separately, Etsy explicitly prohibits drop shipping (with narrow exceptions) and prohibits reselling mass‑produced goods except for allowed categories; it also clarifies that production partners are allowed only when items are the seller's original design and the partner is disclosed.
 This policy context is strategically useful because your "anti‑reseller trust signal" narrative can be anchored in platform rules: you can describe your sourcing and making process in ways that align with Etsy's own definitions of what belongs on the marketplace.

Finally, because H2 is inherently "Apple‑adjacent," claim language should be disciplined. Apple's published trademark guidance emphasises using Apple trademarks appropriately, including not implying endorsement and following Apple's trademark rules.
 Apple also provides separate guidance for "Made for" compatibility marks and icons, reinforcing that compatibility branding must follow Apple trademark/use rules rather than becoming a seller's own quasi‑branding layer.
 Even at the copy level, Apple's editorial guidance recommends model naming clarity (for example, using numeric model naming such as "AirPods Pro 2," rather than generational phrasing).

### Launch economics and the Etsy fee stack

For a premium-priced SKU family, Etsy's fee model is not a rounding error; it materially affects whether €89/€119 can support your target COGS and any paid acquisition.

Etsy's own "Fees & Payments Policy" specifies:

listing fees of $0.20 per listing publication/renewal, with listings generally expiring after four months and renewing on sale when multiple quantities are offered;
a transaction fee of 6.5% of the total order amount (including shipping and gift wrap);
an Offsite Ads fee of 15% for shops under the $10,000 trailing-365-day threshold and 12% above that threshold, with a per-order cap of $100.
In addition, Etsy Payments processing fees vary by bank location. For sellers with an Italy bank account, Etsy's own fee table lists 4% + €0.30 per order as the payment processing fee.
 Italy-based sellers are also subject to a "Regulatory Operating Fee"; Etsy currently lists 0.32% for Italy.

Putting only the core variable fees together for an Italy-based shop (transaction 6.5% + processing 4% + regulatory 0.32%) yields an approximately 10.82% fee rate on the order total, plus the fixed €0.30 processing component, plus the $0.20 listing fee (and VAT on fees where applicable).

A practical way to interpret this for your two launch prices is to think in "fee bands" rather than a single number:

Base Etsy band (no Offsite Ads attributed): ~11% of order total, plus fixed €0.30 and small listing fee overhead.
Offsite Ads band (if attributed): base band + 15% (for early-stage shops under the threshold), pushing total Etsy take-rate closer to the mid‑20% range on order total.
This fee structure reinforces why your internal "photography perception test" gate is economically rational: if photos do not categorise the product as premium, you will be forced into the commodity fee-and-discount dynamics that dominate the "$10–$30" segment—and Etsy fees will amplify margin compression.

### Implications for positioning, imagery, and claim language

The differentiator you describe—one consistent, structured micro‑bag architecture with real closure hardware and facade cues—is directionally aligned with how the luxury market signals value, but Etsy competitiveness depends on translating those cues into instantly legible proof.

A key observation from Etsy's own category landscape is that "mini bag charm" and "AirPods case" searches frequently surface items framed as faux leather novelties and/or personalisable commodity cases.
 In that environment, your listings must clearly prevent misclassification as one of three things: a cheap novelty charm, a digital sewing pattern, or a generic tech cover.

Etsy's policy framework gives you an unusual advantage if you lean into transparency as a brand asset. Etsy requires accurate representation of how an item was made, by whom, and where it is shipped from, and it pushes sellers toward using their own photographs.
 It also draws a clear line against reselling and drop shipping as "handmade," while permitting disclosed production partners for original designs.
 This is a direct response to the trust problem many shoppers perceive in charm categories—especially where lookalike goods are associated with marketplaces such as AliExpress and where online discussion communities such as Reddit frequently warn about resellers.

For H2, copy discipline is also a risk-management tool. Apple's trademark guidance and related compatibility-mark guidance makes it important to avoid implying endorsement or using Apple branding in a way that suggests affiliation.
 Apple's editorial guidance further suggests model naming precision (for example, "AirPods Pro 2"), which aligns with your need to make compatibility unambiguous for buyers scanning Etsy listings quickly.

Finally, the "location variant" concept (H3) can be treated as more than a graphic exercise: tying the facade theme to a specific destination such as the Amalfi Coast can work as an authenticity amplifier, but only if your production method can support consistent, premium-looking graphic execution—because the luxury benchmark set shows that buyers will pay for micro-bag charms when the object reads as a miniature bag, not a printed trinket.
