You will be prompted to opt-in to our terms and conditions.\r\n   2. Upon receiving your opt-in, we will attempt to process the payment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo ensure your booking is successfully completed, we recommend:\r\n\r\n   - Check your email for the opt-in request and payment confirmation.\r\n   - Look in your spam or junk folder if you do not see these emails in your inbox.\r\n\r\nYou may also wish to ensure that emails from us do not go into spam in the future, as further emails will be sent by us that are essential to your stay at the hostel, and others will be useful (how best to get here etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf either of these steps is not completed, the booking may be cancelled. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, cancelled bookings cannot be reinstated.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nPeter Cowling\r\nOwner",

We can cancel your booking, but before we do we would like to take this opportunity to explain the specific details of your booking and its eligibility for a refund.\r\n\r\nWe offer two types of bookings to our customers, one that is not paid in advance and will not incur a fee on cancellation provided it is cancelled within the cancellation period, and the other is the 'pre-paid, non-refundable' type, which is the type of booking you have made. This policy is put in place to provide revenue security, which in turn allows us to offer a discounted rate to our customers. By securing a guaranteed revenue stream, we can afford to pass on savings to our customers.\r\n\r\nAs the name suggests, pre-paid bookings require payment in advance, and once payment has been made, they become non-refundable. We understand that there may be circumstances beyond your control that could prevent you from using your pre-paid booking, such as illness, flight cancellations, or other unforeseen events. However, as stated in our terms and conditions, pre-paid bookings are non-refundable. We always advise our customers to carefully consider the pros and cons of such bookings and to read the terms and conditions carefully before making any commitments. We also recommend that customers consider purchasing appropriate travel insurance to protect themselves in case of unforeseen events.\r\n\r\nIf you have any further queries, please do not hesitate to contact us.\r\n\r\nThank you for choosing to book with us.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nPeter Cowling\r\n\r\nOwner",

These complaints were often vague and difficult to verify, which led to challenging decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nInitially, we attempted to be flexible with the policy, admitting guests who assured us they were easygoing. Unfortunately, despite their assurances, some of these guests later complained about noise levels.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result, we have decided to adhere more strictly to our policy during peak seasons to minimize risks and maintain a comfortable environment for all our guests. During the start and end of the season, when risks are more manageable, we can be more flexible.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge that this policy may not be ideal for everyone, but we believe it is preferable to the alternative.
