description: Weekly startup-loop skill efficiency audit. Scans lp-* + startup-loop + draft-outreach skills with deterministic heuristics (wc-l, grep, ls), emits a ranked opportunity artifact, and fires a planning anchor only on new-to-HIGH findings.

# /meta-loop-efficiency

Weekly audit of startup-loop skill files. Read-only scan. Writes one committed artifact per run.

## Invocation

```
/meta-loop-efficiency                     # default scan, commit artifact
/meta-loop-efficiency --threshold <N>    # custom line threshold (default 200)
/meta-loop-efficiency --dry-run          # print findings; do not commit
```

## Operating Mode

**AUDIT ONLY** — no skill file modifications permitted.
Writes and commits one artifact per run (skipped on `--dry-run`).

## Audit Scope

In-scope: all `lp-*` prefix skills + `startup-loop` + `draft-outreach`.
Out-of-scope: `idea-*`, `meta-*`, `ops-*`, `review-*`, `biz-*`, `guide-*` — never scan these.
Canonical list derived from the startup-loop Stage Model in `startup-loop/SKILL.md`.

**No scope override is supported by design.** Non-loop skill families have different
invocation patterns and their own improvement cadences. For a full cross-portfolio scan,
run this skill against each family directory manually as a one-off operator action.

## Heuristics

All heuristics operate over ALL `.md` files in each skill directory (SKILL.md + modules/ + others), not SKILL.md alone.

### H0 — Duplicate candidate detection

SHA256-hash the content of each in-scope `SKILL.md` (normalize whitespace). Group skills with identical hashes. Emit a "Possible duplicates" section for any group of ≥2. Advisory only; does not affect H1–H3 scoring.

### H1 — Size / modularization

Threshold applies to `SKILL.md` orchestrator line count only:
- `wc -l SKILL.md` > threshold AND no `modules/` → **monolith** (strong signal)
- `wc -l SKILL.md` > threshold AND has `modules/` → **bloated-orchestrator** (weaker signal)
- `wc -l SKILL.md` ≤ threshold → **compliant**

Additional: if `modules/` exists and any module exceeds 400 lines → **module-monolith** advisory (logged, not ranked).

### H2 — Dispatch adoption gap

- `dispatch_refs_any_md`: count of `subagent-dispatch-contract` matches across ALL `.md` files in the skill directory
- `phase_matches_any_md`: matches of anchored heading pattern `^#{1,6}\s+(Phase|Stage|Domain|Step)\s+[0-9]+` across ALL `.md` files
- `dispatch_refs_any_md == 0` AND `phase_matches_any_md ≥ 3` → **dispatch-candidate**

**Implementation note (H2):** Use `grep -h` to suppress filenames before counting — `grep -c` with a single file omits the `filename:` prefix, causing `awk -F:` to produce wrong counts. Correct pattern:
```bash
find "$skill" -name "*.md" -exec grep -hE "^#{1,6} (Phase|Stage|Domain|Step) [0-9]+" {} \; | wc -l
```

### H3 — Wave dispatch adoption

Applies only to skills that reference `lp-do-build` as their execution skill AND have `phase_matches_any_md ≥ 3` (filters out skills that merely name lp-do-build as a downstream step).
If `wave-dispatch-protocol.md` is not referenced in any `.md` file in the directory → **wave-candidate** (advisory).

## Ranking

Produce **two separate hierarchical ranked lists**. Do not merge H1 and H2/H3 signals.

### List 1 — Modularization opportunities (H1)

Rank within each tier by `SKILL.md` lines descending:
1. `high` tier — monolith or bloated-orchestrator
2. `medium` tier
3. `low` tier

### List 2 — Dispatch opportunities (H2 + H3)

Rank within each tier by `phase_matches_any_md` descending:
1. `high` tier — dispatch-candidate or wave-candidate
2. `medium` tier
3. `low` tier

### Invocation tier assignments (fixed)

- **high**: startup-loop, lp-do-build, lp-do-plan, lp-do-replan, lp-sequence, lp-offer, lp-channels, lp-seo, lp-forecast, lp-do-fact-find
- **medium**: lp-launch-qa, lp-design-qa, lp-experiment, lp-design-spec, lp-prioritize, lp-site-upgrade
- **low**: lp-onboarding-audit, lp-assessment-bootstrap, lp-readiness, lp-bos-sync, lp-baseline-merge, lp-measure, draft-outreach

Any `lp-*` skill not listed above defaults to **low** tier. Add new skills here when they enter the loop.

## Delta-Aware Planning Anchor

Always write the artifact. Emit planning anchor ONLY when findings are new:

1. Locate previous artifact: glob `docs/business-os/platform-capability/skill-efficiency-audit-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9].md`, sort lexicographically, take last. Files not matching this exact pattern are excluded (lexicographic order equals timestamp order for this format).
2. For each skill flagged in List 1 or List 2:
   - Not in previous artifact → **new-to-HIGH** → emit planning anchor.
   - Already flagged → status: `known` (suppress anchor for that skill).
3. Any previously compliant skill now flagged → always emit planning anchor (regression).
4. No new items and no regressions → emit:
   > "No new HIGH opportunities since last audit (YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM). Known opportunities remain open — see previous anchor."

## Output Artifact

Path: `docs/business-os/platform-capability/skill-efficiency-audit-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md`

Required header (first 6 lines of artifact body):
```
scan_timestamp: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
threshold: <N> lines
scope: lp-*, startup-loop, draft-outreach
git_sha: <HEAD SHA 7 chars>
previous_artifact: <filename or "none">
skills_scanned: <N>
```

Artifact sections:
1. **Scan summary** — header + scanned/compliant/opportunity counts
2. **Possible duplicates** (H0)
3. **List 1 — Modularization opportunities** (H1, hierarchical)
4. **List 2 — Dispatch opportunities** (H2/H3, hierarchical)
5. **Planning anchor** — when new-to-HIGH items exist: suggest `/lp-do-fact-find startup-loop-token-efficiency-v2`
6. **Delta status** — new-vs-known breakdown, regression flags

## Commit Guard

Before writing/committing the artifact:
1. Run `git status --porcelain`.
2. Stage ONLY the artifact file by explicit path: `git add docs/business-os/platform-capability/skill-efficiency-audit-<stamp>.md`
3. Verify with `git diff --cached --name-only` that only the artifact is staged.
4. If any unrelated files appear staged → abort; warn operator; do not commit.
5. Use writer lock: `scripts/agents/with-writer-lock.sh --wait-forever -- git commit`

Note: a dirty working tree (other unstaged changes) does NOT block the commit, provided
only the artifact file is staged. Use `--dry-run` to inspect output without committing.

## Heuristic Evolution

To extend or update this skill:
1. Add new heuristic `H<N>` section under `## Heuristics`.
2. Update `## Ranking` lists to include the new signal.
3. Add tier entries for any new `lp-*` skills added since last update.
4. Keep SKILL.md ≤200 lines; extract to `modules/heuristics.md` if needed.
