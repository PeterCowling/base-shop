## 1. Executive Summary
Dry-run completed under `grow-business` stance with full coverage and zero writes. Primary constraints shifted toward market traction: PIPE lacks a real first-sale loop, BRIK lacks conversion-anchored growth instrumentation, and BOS lacks repeatable growth-experiment governance.

## 2. Businesses Analyzed
- BRIK (L2): growth is constrained by missing conversion telemetry and offer-testing loop (`docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/plan.user.md:22`, `docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/plan.user.md:74`).
- PIPE (L1): no validated first-customer flow; fulfillment and demand evidence still unproven (`docs/business-os/strategy/PIPE/plan.user.md:18`, `docs/business-os/strategy/PIPE/plan.user.md:64`).
- PLAT (L3+ infra): delivery foundations are adequate but growth-facing experiments need faster instrumentation support (`docs/business-os/strategy/PLAT/plan.user.md:17`, `docs/business-os/strategy/PLAT/plan.user.md:64`).
- BOS (coordination): no measurable experiment throughput for growth bets (`docs/business-os/strategy/BOS/plan.user.md:72`, `docs/business-os/strategy/BOS/plan.user.md:78`).

## 3. Who Said What (F1)
| Idea | Business | Originator Sub-Expert | Lens | Confidence Tier | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PIPE First-Customer Sprint (14-day traction test) | PIPE | drucker-coordinator | drucker-porter | presentable | promote |
| BRIK Direct-Booking Conversion Sprint | BRIK | ogilvy | marketing | presentable | promote |
| BOS Growth Experiment Review Cadence | BOS | vantharp | musk | presentable | promote |
| PLAT Experiment Telemetry Acceleration Layer | PLAT | bezos | bezos | presentable | promote |
| PIPE Catalog expansion before verified demand | PIPE | finder | sourcing | decision-gap | hold |
| BRIK multilingual expansion without conversion baseline | BRIK | hopkins | marketing | decision-gap | hold |

## 4. Reaffirmations/Addenda
- Reaffirmed BRIK dashboard stream as enabling work for conversion monitoring (`docs/business-os/cards/BRIK-ENG-0018.user.md`).

## 5. Generation Phase
Generation cadence respected:
- Divergence pass produced 12 raw candidates.
- Deepening pass selected top 8 candidates (hard cap <=10 per business).
- No sub-expert exceeded divergence cap.

## 6. Depth Gate
- 8/8 deepened candidates satisfied Evidence-Pointers/Falsification-Test/First-Signal requirements.
- 2 items rerouted to decision-gap due to missing immediate traction evidence.

## 7. Confidence Gate
- Presentable: 6
- Decision-gap: 2
- Hunches: 0

## 8. Assumption Challenge (F3)
Assumptions-Source was `none`; no accept/condition/reject assumption verdict set was required.

## 9. Clustering
- 6 clusters formed, business-scoped only.
- Clear rivalry detected: "expand catalog now" vs "validate one repeatable demand loop first".

## 10. Tool-Gap Register (F2)
| Gap-Type | Missing tool/data gap | Impacted business | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| traction | no first-customer outreach + conversion tracking playbook | PIPE | `docs/business-os/strategy/PIPE/plan.user.md:18` |
| conversion | no direct-booking funnel telemetry baseline | BRIK | `docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/plan.user.md:22` |
| experiment-ops | no weekly growth experiment scoreboard | BOS | `docs/business-os/strategy/BOS/plan.user.md:72` |
| telemetry | no rapid experiment instrumentation lane for product changes | PLAT | `docs/business-os/strategy/PLAT/plan.user.md:64` |

## 11. Contrarian Gate
- PASS: 4
- UNRESOLVED: 2
- FAIL: 0

## 12. Munger/Buffett Filter
- Promote: 4
- Hold: 2
- Kill: 0

## 13. Kill/Hold Rationale (F4)
| Idea | Verdict | Reason code | Reason | Restart condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PIPE catalog expansion before verified demand | hold | HOLD-TRAC-01 | prioritizing catalog complexity before first repeatable demand signal | restart when >=5 real purchase intents and >=1 completed paid order are logged |
| BRIK multilingual expansion without conversion baseline | hold | HOLD-TRAC-02 | growth spend should not expand channels before conversion baseline is stable | restart when 2-week conversion baseline is established and directional uplift test exists |

No kill verdicts this run.

## 14. Drucker/Porter Priority
- P1: 2
- P2: 2
- P3: 0
- P4: 1
- P5: 1

## 15. Economics Gate (F5)
- pass: 4
- blocked: 2

Economics fields captured for promoted ideas:
- upside: fastest path to revenue-signal learning and better allocation.
- downside: bounded short-term effort diverted from non-essential expansion work.
- reversibility: high; traction experiments are timeboxed and easy to stop.
- cost-of-delay: high for PIPE/BRIK because current growth choices are under-instrumented.
- time-to-signal: 7-14 days for initial traction and conversion outcomes.

Blocked ideas remained held where economics completeness depended on unresolved traction data.

## 16. Cards Created / Preview
Dry-run preview only; no API writes.

| Business | Would-Create Card Title | Priority | Lane | Owner | Why now |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PIPE | PIPE First-Customer Sprint (14-day traction test) | P1 | Inbox | Pete | fastest path to first repeatable demand signal |
| BRIK | BRIK Direct-Booking Conversion Sprint | P1 | Inbox | Pete | improves conversion economics before broader expansion |
| BOS | BOS Growth Experiment Review Cadence | P2 | Inbox | Pete | creates operator discipline for growth experiments |
| PLAT | PLAT Experiment Telemetry Acceleration Layer | P2 | Inbox | Pete | reduces lag between experiment launch and insight |

## 17. Fact-Find Seeding / Preview
Dry-run preview only; no stage-doc writes.

| Rank | Would-Seed Fact-Find For | Priority | Template | Selection basis |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | PIPE First-Customer Sprint | P1 | traction-fast-track | highest revenue-signal urgency |
| 2 | BRIK Direct-Booking Conversion Sprint | P1 | traction-fast-track | strongest near-term margin/conversion leverage |
| 3 | BOS Growth Experiment Review Cadence | P2 | standard | governance dependency for sustained growth learning |

## 18. Existing Card Addenda
Existing cards were handled only as reaffirmation/addendum notes; no Top-K mixing.

## 19. Technical Cabinet
Status: not triggered for this run.
No `--force-code-review` flag and no improve-data stance trigger were used.

## 20. DGPs Created
| Business | DGP Title | Gap-Type | VOI-Score | Decision blocked |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| PIPE | PIPE demand proof before catalog scale | data | 0.92 | whether to expand catalog infrastructure now |
| BRIK | BRIK multilingual growth sequencing | timing | 0.78 | whether to expand channels before conversion baseline stabilizes |

## 21. DGP Resurfacing
No ready-now or watch-queue DGP resurfacing candidates were found in this run context.
