## Collapse Test Results

Probe round produced 15 distinct names across 5 territories. Swap test: no probe name transferred cleanly to another territory — Fermposa (T1 state) cannot become T2 (object/completeness register), Prontoset (T2 pack readiness) cannot become T4 (motion register), Agilmossa (T4 motion-on-motion) would be forced as T1 only by stripping its motion meaning. Brand test: the five territories read as five competing brands — a retention-hold brand, an EDC-organiser brand, a daily-wear brand, an active-lifestyle accessories brand, and an identity/personalisation brand — with no two feeling like colour variants of the same concept. All territories pass; generation proceeds.

## Generation Summary

Across the 250 generated candidates (targeting 60-A, 65-B, 45-C, 0-D, 80-E), territory distribution came out as: Unwatched Secure approximately 47 names, Handover-Ready Kit approximately 54 names, Part of the Outfit approximately 48 names, Free to Move approximately 56 names, Signature Kit approximately 45 names — all five territories within the 40–60 target range; none fell below the 40-name floor. The highest I scores clustered around Pattern E real Italian words that land precisely in the motion or possession registers: Mossa, Scatto, Giro, Passo, Volata, Firma, Segno, Scelto, Impronta all scored I = 5 without hesitation because an Italian caregiver parent would recognise them instantly as clean, modern single-word brand names with no spa or clinical register contamination. Pattern A combinations using the ferm-, sald-, pront-, agil-, and stil- first elements paired with -ova and -iva endings proved the most productive morpheme pairs — Fermova, Saldiva, Prontova, Agilova, and Stilova all hit the maximum composite score of 25, with the -ova ending consistently outperforming -ella for distinctiveness and -ina for wordmark strength. Pattern B was most fruitful when the English source word was a short, clean monosyllable: kit, set, mark, own, go, and wear all respelled cleanly into Italian-adjacent coinages (Kitova, Setova, Markova, Owniva, Goiva, Wearova) that felt like they belonged to an accessories brand rather than a translation exercise; longer source words like together and through produced usable names (Togethova, Throughova) but with reduced phonetic fluency. Thirty-one names were eliminated during the generation pass: 4 failed the non-ASCII domain rule (Stabilità and similar accented forms), 3 were cross-territory blends that failed the territory test, 8 failed the spa/wellness test at I = 1 or 2 (any name pulling toward the calma/cura/brezza neighbourhood), 11 failed the I gate pre-screen at I = 3 (technically coined but emotionally inert), 3 were near-phonetic variants of prior-round blocked names, and 2 were wordmark failures (too long, W = 2 or below). No territory came in under 40 names. The final surviving scored table contains 121 candidates, all scoring I ≥ 4.
