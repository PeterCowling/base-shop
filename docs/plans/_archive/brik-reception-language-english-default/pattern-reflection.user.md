# Pattern Reflection — BRIK Reception Language: English Default

## Patterns

None identified.

No recurring deterministic or ad-hoc patterns emerged from this build. The work was a one-time correction of Italian strings introduced during rapid feature development. No repeatable workflow gap was revealed; screens added in the future should default to English per existing convention.

## Access Declarations

None identified.

All build work was confined to local source files. No external APIs, MCP tools, or credentials were required.
