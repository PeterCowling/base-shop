# Business Name Research Prompt — Cochlear Implant Headband Brand

**How to use:** Drop this prompt into a deep research tool (Perplexity Deep Research, Claude, or equivalent). The goal is a research-grounded framework for evaluating names — not a shortlist of invented words. All factual claims must be cited.

**Language:** en-GB. **Current date:** 2026-02-19 (Europe/Rome). State dates for any time-sensitive findings (domain status, trade mark filings, competitor availability).

## Role and method

You are a naming strategist and researcher. Your job is to produce a research-grounded framework that a brand owner can use to brief a naming designer and to evaluate future name candidates. Do not produce a long list of invented names. Use web research and cite sources for all factual statements and all competitor, domain, and trade mark checks. Separate clearly: (a) what you checked, (b) what you inferred, and (c) what remains unknown without professional legal counsel.

## Business context

I am launching a direct-to-consumer lifestyle brand selling **soft retention headbands** that keep external cochlear implant (CI) sound processors secure during daily life — school, play, sport, sleep, and everyday activity.

**Critical positioning:** This is a comfort, retention, and aesthetic accessory for existing CI users. It makes no medical efficacy claims and is not a medical device.

**Regulatory nuance to encode explicitly:** Under EU MDR, an "accessory for a medical device" is defined as an article intended to be used *together* with a medical device to enable it to be used in accordance with its intended purpose, or to assist its medical functionality. Even without marketing the headband as a medical device, intended-use language used in brand naming and storytelling can drift into "enabling" medical functionality. Flag any name or messaging territory that could be interpreted as a medical-purpose claim (e.g., "restore", "improve hearing", "therapy", "treatment") or as framing the product as necessary for the implant to work. Focus on comfort, security, and everyday usability language — not treatment or therapy outcomes.

**Primary customer:** Parents and caregivers of young children (approximately 6 months+) with cochlear implants. They are buying because the processor falls off or shifts during activity — a constant practical frustration with an emotional dimension (this is on their child's head every day).

**Secondary customers:** Active and sport-oriented CI users of any age; adult daily-comfort users.

**Launch market:** Italy (primary), then broader EU and US. The brand will use English as its primary language but must feel accessible and trustworthy to Italian-speaking buyers.

**Price range:** EUR 12–32 (core tier EUR 18–32).

**Emotional territory:** Reassuring (not clinical). Practical (not purely aspirational). Approachable (not jargon-heavy). Inclusive — normalises wearing a headband alongside a CI processor; does not stigmatise the device or suggest hiding it. Warm (not corporate or device-manufacturer adjacent).

**Market sizing (treat as verify-and-cite, not assumed true):** Italy is reported to have approximately 17,000 CI users; global CI installed base is cited as approximately one million. Verify these figures and cite sources with dates before using them as assumptions.

**Growth intent:** The brand may expand beyond headbands into adjacent hearing-accessory lifestyle products (pouches, processor covers, clips, tethers) and possibly into other hearing device communities. Naming territory and trade mark strategy should accommodate this from the outset.

## Current working name (baseline comparator only)

**CochlearFit** — do not treat this as a constraint. It is functional and descriptive but has weaknesses: "Cochlear" is closely associated with Cochlear Limited (the world's largest CI manufacturer, a public company); "Fit" is generic and overused in fitness and activewear; together they read as a product descriptor, not a brand; and the name would be difficult to extend beyond headbands. Use it as a benchmark for comparison.

---

## Naming criteria

A strong name for this brand should:

1. Be pronounceable and memorable in English; ideally comfortable in Italian phonetics
2. Avoid implying medical function (no treatment, therapy, or clinical benefit claims; regulatory constraint)
3. Feel warm and human, not device-manufacturer or clinical-brand adjacent
4. Have room to grow — extensible to future accessories and adjacent hearing device communities
5. Be distinctive within the category (see competitive landscape below)
6. Be plausibly ownable: no obvious trade mark conflicts, plausible domain availability

**Trade mark screening scope:** Flag obvious conflicts in Nice Classification Class 25 (clothing, footwear, headwear — the primary class for a headband) and Class 10 (surgical, medical, dental and veterinary apparatus; therapeutic and assistive devices for persons with disabilities). When referencing classes, use authoritative Nice Classification headings. Note that this is a preliminary risk flag, not a legal clearance opinion.

**Distinctiveness spectrum:** Assess each name direction against the standard trade mark distinctiveness spectrum — generic → descriptive → suggestive → arbitrary → coined. Descriptive terms tend to be weaker as trade mark badges of origin and may face refusal under EU trade mark practice if immediately perceived as conveying the characteristics or purpose of the goods. Flag where a name direction lands on this spectrum and note the trade-off between consumer legibility and legal protectability.

---

## Anti-criteria (hard constraints)

Do not propose names that:

- Use "cochlear" as a component — too closely associated with Cochlear Limited (LSX-listed public company; flagship product is the "Cochlear Nucleus" processor)
- Use audiology or disability-identity terms ("hearing loss", "deaf", "impaired") unless explicitly pursuing a validated community-identity brand strategy
- Sound like a medical device, pharmaceutical, or clinical brand
- Are acronyms or initialisms as the primary brand element
- Imply hiding or disguising the CI processor ("stealth", "invisible", "discreet", "conceal") — the brand normalises wearing, not concealment
- Are too generic to be searchable or ownable ("kidsbands", "headbandshop")
- Have obvious negative connotations in Italian; also scan Spanish, French, and German as likely EU languages of encounter

## Competitive naming landscape to map

Research and map these competitors, then add 3–6 additional relevant comparators you find during research. Include, as a **separate comparator class**, official accessory naming from major CI manufacturers — these establish the "baseline functional" naming register and create potential confusion vectors for a new lifestyle brand.

**Independent brands:**
- PowerAiD
- SmartEAR
- hearinghenry
- Deafmetal
- BAHA Accessories UK
- CI Retention Solutions

**Official manufacturer accessory naming (research and include):** For example, Cochlear Limited's retention headband products; MED-EL fixation/sport accessories; Advanced Bionics accessories. Note what these are called, what the naming convention is (manufacturer-led, functional, descriptive), and what trust anchor they rely on.

For each competitor and comparator, identify:
- Naming territory (descriptive/functional, ear/hearing anchored, lifestyle/identity, coined, founder-style, manufacturer-led)
- Emotional tone
- Any confusion risks (phonetics, structure, abbreviations, domain/trade mark proximity)
- What territory their name occupies — contributing to a "crowded vs open" map

---

## Research tracks and required outputs

### Track 1: Naming convention analysis

Analyse the dominant naming patterns across CI and hearing-accessory brands. Identify what is crowded and what represents open territory. Ground all observations in competitor examples and cite sources where you describe what a competitor sells or how they position themselves. Output a structured "crowded vs open" conclusions section.

### Track 2: Naming territory exploration

Evaluate five territories. For each territory, provide 3–5 name *directions* (short illustrative examples that convey the territory — not necessarily final names), then assess:
- Strategic logic and fit with the brand criteria
- Risks: regulatory tone drift, stigma risk, trade mark descriptiveness risk, Italian phonetic awkwardness, expansion constraints
- Distinctiveness spectrum placement (generic → descriptive → suggestive → arbitrary → coined)
- How naturally this territory could extend to future products

**Territory A — Retention/security language (elevated, non-clinical):** Names that reference keeping something in place, holding, stability — elevated above generic ("anchor", "hold", "secure") without sounding clinical or device-adjacent.

**Territory B — Lifestyle/everyday normalisation (no device reference):** Names that reference daily life, movement, childhood, activity — without referencing the cochlear implant or hearing at all. The product works *for* the child's life, not *for* the cochlear implant.

**Territory C — Inclusive community identity (warm insider signals):** Names that signal belonging to a community of CI wearers and their families; warm, insider, human. Requires sensitivity: explicit disability identity (e.g., Deafmetal) is a strong strategy but needs community validation. Flag this risk.

**Territory D — Sensory/sound metaphor (non-medical connotations):** Names that reference sound, listening, music, signal — without medical device or therapy connotations. Assess whether any such name risks drifting into medical-function implication.

**Territory E — Coined/invented (EN+IT-friendly phonetics; extensible):** Short invented words with no direct meaning but good phonetics in English and Italian; memorable; extensible across product range. Assess how easily these can be registered as trade marks (arbitrary/coined marks tend to be the most protectable).

### Track 3: Italian market suitability

For the top 10–15 name directions that emerge from Track 2:
- Italian phonetics: ease of pronunciation, stress placement, consonant clusters
- Unintended meaning, homophones, or connotations in Italian
- Quick risk scan in Spanish, French, and German for EU expansion (Italy first, but flag major blockers in likely expansion markets)
- Whether the name feels approachable to Italian-speaking parents who are not confident English speakers

### Track 4: Domain and trade mark risk flags

For the top 10–15 name directions:

**Domain:** Is the .com taken? If taken, what is it used for — assess confusion risk as low/medium/high. Note that domain availability and trade mark availability are correlated but not determinative of each other.

**Trade marks:** Screen for obvious conflicts in Nice Classes 25 and 10. Note if another class appears especially relevant (e.g., Class 35 retail services). Reference EUIPO class headings. State clearly: (a) what you checked, (b) what you inferred, and (c) what remains uncertain without a full EUIPO/national registry search and legal opinion. This is not a clearance — flag risks only.

**EU language screen:** Flag any name that is descriptive or problematic in Italian, Spanish, French, or German — EU trade mark practice can refuse marks that are descriptive in any EU language.

### Track 5: Expansion headroom

Identify which naming territories from Track 2 would best support expansion from headbands into broader hearing-accessory lifestyle products, and which territories would trap the brand in a single product category. Reference the Deafmetal model (started with jewellery for hearing device wearers; expanded into a broader lifestyle accessory community brand) as a benchmark for how territory choice affects long-run brand architecture.

## Deliverables format

Write as a research document in en-GB. Use citations throughout. Do not bury findings in prose — use structured tables and scored/ranked lists where appropriate. Required sections:

1. **Market sizing verification** — verify and cite the Italy ~17,000 and global ~1M CI user figures; note source and date
2. **Competitive naming map** — structured, with a "crowded vs open territory" conclusion section; include manufacturer official accessory naming as a separate comparator class
3. **Territory evaluation** — all five territories with name directions, rationale, risks, distinctiveness spectrum placement, and expansion fit
4. **Italian + EU suitability notes** — top 10–15 directions; phonetics, connotations, cross-language risk flags
5. **Domain and trade mark risk flags** — top 10–15 directions; clearly label what was checked vs inferred vs unknown; note domain status with date observed
6. **Distinctiveness spectrum summary** — for all shortlisted directions, where they land on generic → descriptive → suggestive → arbitrary → coined, and implications for trade mark protectability
7. **Recommended shortlist** — 5–8 directions to develop next, ranked by: (a) strategic differentiation, (b) Italian accessibility, (c) expansion headroom, (d) likely ownability/distinctiveness. Include a 2–3 sentence rationale per direction.
8. **Recommended territory (forced choice)** — if forced to pick one territory to develop first, which and why? Describe concretely what a brand in that territory feels like to an Italian parent finding it via search or a CI community forum post.
