# TASK-04 — Photography Brief: Dog Holder

**Target:** ≥5 shots — hero + lifestyle + detail + scale
**Format:** 2000×2000px minimum, square crop preferred for Etsy

---

## Before You Shoot

**What makes or breaks premium dog accessory photos:**
- Natural light (window) or diffused lamp — never flash directly on the bag
- Background: white card, linen, dark wood, or outdoor pavement/grass — no busy surfaces
- Keep the bag clean — no fingerprints on the leash clip, no lint on fabric
- The leash clip is the hero hardware detail — show it clearly
- Dog lifestyle context > studio flat lay. Shoot in context where possible.

---

## Required Shots

### D1 — Hero: Holder on a dog lead in use *(lead shot)*

| Shot | Setup | What to show |
|---|---|---|
| **D1-A** *(lead shot)* | Clip the holder onto a real dog lead or harness strap. Natural light. | Holder hanging naturally, leash clip clearly visible, full body of holder |

> D1-A is the lead Etsy photo. The leash clip in context communicates immediate function.
> Everything depends on this shot reading as premium.

---

### D2 — Lifestyle: Dog walk setting

| Shot | Setup | What to show |
|---|---|---|
| **D2-A** | Holder clipped on lead, shot outdoors — pavement, park, or terrace | Context and aspiration — this is what the buyer is imagining |
| **D2-B** | Holder on lead with dog visible in background (optional — use if dog available) | Buyer lifestyle identification — "this is me on my walk" |

> If no dog is available, D2-B is optional. Holder + lead in outdoor context is sufficient.

---

### D3 — Detail: Hardware and quality

| Shot | Setup | What to show |
|---|---|---|
| **D3-A** | Extreme close-up of the leash clip and clasp/hardware | Texture and quality detail — this justifies €80 |

---

### D4 — Editorial flat lay

| Shot | Setup | What to show |
|---|---|---|
| **D4-A** | Flat lay on white card or linen, slight angle, leash clip visible | Clean editorial feel — whole holder from slightly above |

---

### D5 — Scale reference

| Shot | Setup | What to show |
|---|---|---|
| **D5-A** | Holder next to a recognisable item on white surface (sunglasses, keys, or hand) | Buyers always ask "how big is it?" — answer this without text |

---

## Perception Test

After the shoot, pick the best D1-A or D2-A photo. Show it unlabelled to **5 people
who haven't seen the product** — a guest, friend, or anyone nearby. Ask only:

> *"What is this, and what would you expect to pay for it?"*

**Pass:** ≥3 out of 5 say €60 or more unprompted → proceed to TASK-06 (Etsy) and TASK-07 (social).
**Fail:** fewer than 3 → reshoot D1-A with better light or outdoor context before proceeding.

(Note: €60 bar, not €80 — dog accessory buyers have a different reference frame than
handbag buyers. The market data supports €80 as premium; but perception test is
set conservatively to gate quality, not to anchor price.)

Record the result below.
