# HEAD Weekly K/P/C/S Decision

## A) KPI Delta Summary

- This is week-0 initialization (no live commercial metrics yet).
- Baseline remains: orders 0, revenue 0, CAC unmeasured, returns unmeasured.

## B) Decision

Decision: **Continue**.

Rationale:
- Outcome contract is now locked.
- Intake, market intelligence, site-upgrade brief, baseline seed, and prioritization scorecard are active.
- Immediate next step is execution instrumentation and operational confirmation, not strategy pivot.

## C) What Changed This Week

Signal:
- Canonical inputs for HEAD loop were activated (intake packet, blocker interview, prioritization scorecard).
- Mapping readiness gate moved to warning/pass for active scope.

Noise:
- No live demand/economics data yet; no scale/kill call can be made.

## D) Next-Week Action Plan

1. Confirm stock date and sellable units in seed.
2. Confirm compatibility matrix and publish fit/support guidance.
3. Establish analytics and payment reliability baseline.
4. Start capped week-1 acquisition test with daily CAC/CVR tracking.
5. Prepare week-2 forecast recalibration artifact.

## E) Risk Watchlist

- Compatibility ambiguity can inflate returns.
- Missing payment/returns clarity can suppress conversion.
- Lack of measured CVR/CAC can delay decision-grade planning.

## F) Data Quality Issues

- No observed traffic/conversion data yet.
- No observed returns and payment-success distributions yet.
