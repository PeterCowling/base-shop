  "intro": "The Naples Airport to Positano bus is a two-stage journey: take the Curreri Viaggi bus from the airport to Sorrento (75 minutes, €10), then transfer to the SITA bus from Sorrento to Positano (50 minutes, €2.60).\n\nTotal journey time is approximately 2.5 hours plus connection wait time. This guide covers 2026 ticket prices, where to buy tickets, how to read the SITA timetable, and step-by-step directions from the Chiesa Nuova bus stop to Hostel Brikette.\n\nIf you're arriving from %LINK:naplesCenterTrainBus|Naples city center instead of the airport%, see our train-bus guide for that route.",

Total cost is approximately €12.60 (Curreri €10 + SITA €2.60) compared to €100-140 for a private transfer.\n\nThe Curreri Viaggi bus departs from Naples Airport Terminal 1 arrivals level and runs multiple times daily year-round. Services operate approximately every 90 minutes during peak season (April-October) and every 2-3 hours in winter (November-March).\n\nFrom Sorrento, SITA buses to Positano run approximately every 40-60 minutes in summer (April-October) and every 60-90 minutes in winter (November-March). Check current timetables at sitasudtrasporti.it before travel as services change seasonally.\n\nPlan for 3-3.5 hours total including transfer time in Sorrento. This route does not run from Terminal 3 (private aviation) — you must transfer to Terminal 1 first.",

Look for blue-and-white Curreri signage and a small ticket booth.\n\nYou can purchase tickets online at curreriviaggi.it or at the ticket booth at the bus stop. The booth opens 30 minutes before the first departure. Tickets cost €10 per person one-way (2026 season). Payment methods: cash and card accepted at the booth; card or PayPal required for online booking.\n\nBuses are clearly marked 'Sorrento' on the front. Board when the driver opens the doors (usually 10-15 minutes before departure). Luggage goes in the undercarriage storage compartment at no extra charge — the driver will open it for you.\n\nJourney time is 75 minutes. The bus follows the A3 motorway then the SS145 coastal road into Sorrento. Seats are assigned first-come, first-served. Buses can fill up in peak summer (July-August), so book online 1-2 days ahead if traveling on weekends.\n\nThere is no toilet on board, so use airport facilities before boarding. The bus makes no stops between the airport and Sorrento.",

      "body": "The Curreri bus stops at Sorrento's main bus station (Circumvesuviana train station building). Exit the bus and collect your luggage from the undercarriage.\n\nBefore boarding the SITA bus, you must buy your ticket — SITA buses do not sell tickets on board. Look for a nearby bar, tabacchi (tobacco shop), or newsstand displaying the SITA logo. The ticket office is often located at Bar Circolo or Bar Fauno, both within 100 meters of the bus station exit.\n\nAsk for 'un biglietto per Positano' (a ticket to Positano). Cost is €2.60 (2026). You can also use the EAV Campania app to purchase digital tickets, but in our experience, the physical ticket is more reliable.\n\nOnce you have your ticket, walk to the SITA bus stop (look for the blue-and-white SITA sign). Buses to Positano are marked 'Amalfi via Positano' or simply 'Amalfi'.\n\nBuses depart approximately every 40-60 minutes in high season (April-October) and every 60-90 minutes in low season (November-March). Peak summer services (July-August) may run every 30 minutes.\n\nThe journey to Positano takes 45-50 minutes. We recommend sitting on the right side of the bus for stunning coastal views. The road is narrow and winding — this is one of the world's most scenic bus routes.\n\nFor detailed help reading the timetable and choosing your stop, see our %LINK:chiesaNuovaDepartures|Chiesa Nuova departures guide%.",

Subtract 45-50 minutes to estimate departure from Sorrento.\n\n(4) Services marked 'Festivi' run Sundays and public holidays only. Services marked 'Feriali' run Monday-Saturday.\n\n(5) Some buses skip certain stops — if you see a dash instead of a time, that bus doesn't stop there.\n\nAlways check the current timetable at sitasudtrasporti.it or ask at the ticket counter. Download a photo of the current schedule to your phone before traveling in case internet access is limited along the coast."

Tell the driver 'Chiesa Nuova, per favore' when boarding so they know where you're getting off.\n\nPress the stop button when you see Bar Internazionale on your right.

Journey is direct along the motorway with mountain views.\n\nThe SITA bus ride is spectacular but nerve-wracking if you're not used to narrow coastal roads. Drivers are experienced and make this journey multiple times daily, but the road has tight turns and steep drops with minimal barriers. Sit on the right side for the best coastal views (and less exposure to the cliff edge if heights make you nervous).\n\nBoth services run year-round, but winter schedules (November-March) are significantly reduced. Summer schedules (April-October) are frequent and reliable, though buses can be standing-room-only by mid-morning in peak season (July-August). If traveling in high summer, aim for early morning departures to avoid standing room.\n\nFrom the hostel, we've found most guests find the journey straightforward once they understand the steps.

      "q": "Is this route suitable for travelers with heavy luggage?",
      "a": "Yes, but it can be challenging during peak times. The Curreri bus has dedicated luggage storage. The SITA bus has limited luggage space, so board early if you have large bags. The walk from Chiesa Nuova bus stop to the hostel is flat and under 2 minutes, so luggage is manageable upon arrival. If you prefer, consider using our porter services or a private transfer."

    {
      "q": "Are there toilets on the buses?",
      "a": "No. Neither the Curreri bus nor the SITA bus has toilet facilities. Use the toilets at Naples Airport before boarding the Curreri bus, and use the facilities at Sorrento bus station (there's a small cafe with toilets) before boarding the SITA bus."
