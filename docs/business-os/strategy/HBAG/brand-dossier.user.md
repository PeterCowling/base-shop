# Handbag Accessory — Brand Dossier

> **Draft status.** Positioning tier locked 2026-02-17: **Premium (€80–€150)**.
> No app or theme package exists yet. Audience, palette, and typography are directional
> pending first customer inputs (≥3 after first 10 sales).

## Audience

**Primary:** TBD — women purchasing handbag accessories. The specific segment (price point, age, style preference, geography) is not yet defined. The plan notes that the offer hypothesis "exists but is not encoded in measurable commercial terms."

**Secondary:** TBD — gift purchasers; potential wholesale/boutique buyers if B2B applicable.

**Device:** TBD — assumed mobile-first for a fashion/lifestyle accessory product, but must be validated.

**Context:** TBD — handbag accessories are likely discovered via visual search (Instagram, Pinterest, Google Shopping) and purchased via high-intent fashion/lifestyle keywords. The purchase is aesthetic + practical (does it fit my bag? does it look good?). Brand perception and trust matter.

**Key constraint:** Brand identity is heavily dependent on price positioning and style aesthetic — which require the offer hypothesis to be locked first. A luxury handbag chain accessory needs a completely different visual identity than a functional mass-market insert.

## Personality

> Positioning locked: **Premium (€80–€150)**, confirmed Pete 2026-02-17.
> Validate with ≥3 customer inputs after first 10 sales.

- **Sophisticated + curated** — clean, minimal, aspirational without being inaccessible
- **Feminine**, not generic
- **Confident**, not apologetic — own the quality story, don't over-justify the price
- **Tasteful**, not trend-chasing — the bag charm trend is an entry point, not the identity

## Visual Identity

> TBD — No design work has been done. All fields below are directional candidates only.
> Theme package creation is a prerequisite for Active status.

### Color Palette

| Role | Token (proposed) | Rationale |
|------|-----------------|-----------|
| Primary | TBD | Depends strongly on price/style positioning. Luxury: black, deep navy, champagne. Accessible: warm neutrals, muted blush, sage. Functional: clean white or stone + 1 accent. |
| Primary soft | TBD | Tinted card/highlight background |
| Accent | TBD | Should feel tasteful and intentional — not trendy-for-its-own-sake |
| Background | TBD | Premium feel. Clean, light backgrounds typical for fashion/accessory e-commerce. |

**Palette mood:** TBD — depends on price positioning. Directional: refined, not loud.

### Typography

| Role | Token (proposed) | Source | Rationale |
|------|-----------------|--------|-----------|
| Body + headings | TBD | TBD | Fashion/accessory category: consider a slightly more editorial feel than Brikette. Humanist sans or elegant serif hybrid. Validate legibility at small sizes on mobile. |

### Shape & Elevation

> TBD — accessories often use clean, minimal cards with subtle shadow. Validate after design direction is set.

### Token Rationale

> Token rationale will be populated when the theme package is created. No theme package exists yet.

| Token | Design rationale |
|-------|-----------------|
| _(all TBD)_ | No app or theme package exists. Populate when created via `/lp-design-spec`. |

**Dark mode:** TBD — decide when theme package is created.

### Imagery Direction

> TBD — Directional candidates:
> - **Do:** Styled product photography in lifestyle context (bag + accessory in use). Clean, flattering lighting. Show the accessory solving a real problem (organization, protection, style).
> - **Don't:** Generic e-commerce product-on-white-background photography for primary hero images. Over-styled editorial that feels unrelatable.
> - Validate after offer lock and competitor imagery audit.

## Voice & Tone

### Writing Style

> TBD — pending offer lock. Directional:
- **Formality:** Conversational and confident. Not corporate; not overly casual.
- **Technical level:** Functional details matter (dimensions, compatibility, materials) — state them clearly.
- **Emotional layer:** Help customers visualize the product making their daily bag use better/easier/more beautiful.

### Key Phrases

> TBD — Validate after offer lock with ≥3 customer inputs.

### Words to Avoid

> TBD — Validate after offer lock. Generic initial candidates:
> - Generic fashion filler ("luxurious," "premium," "exclusive" without substantiation)
> - Compatibility claims that aren't verified ("fits all handbags")

## Signature Patterns

> TBD — No application has been built yet. Patterns will be added as `/lp-design-spec` identifies them.

_First pattern to define: product-in-context imagery component (showing the accessory installed/in-use in a real bag)._

## App Coverage

| App | Theme | Status | Notes |
|-----|-------|--------|-------|
| cover-me-pretty | TBD | Not created | App exists in name only (`cover-me-pretty`); theme package TBD per design-spec mapping |

> **Prerequisite for Active:** offer must be locked, cover-me-pretty app must be built, theme package must be created, and Token-Source must be a real file path.
