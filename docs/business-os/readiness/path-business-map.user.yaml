  - Register `HOLDCO` as a first-class business/system in `docs/business-os/strategy/businesses.json` so `apps/skylar/` can be mapped to a canonical business ID.
  - Confirm whether scripts/ should be split into PLAT vs BOS mapping domains.
  - Confirm whether packages/mcp-server should map to PLAT only or PLAT+BOS.
