---

## Context and Approach

This is the second naming round for the HBAG mini-handbag / bag-charm brand (€89–149 premium artisan, Amalfi Coast origin story). The full brand strategy and positioning background is in `brand-dossier.user.md` and the Round 1 shortlist.

**Round 1 lesson:** All four top-ranked coined Italian-phonetic names (Veloria, Orivella, Marevia, Cintara) lost their .com domains between research and decision. Coined Italian-phonetic territory (Territory C) scored best on distinctiveness and ownability — bias toward more of these in Round 2, with harder domain pressure-testing.

**Domain assessment method:** Each candidate was searched directly and via brand/domain search queries. "Signal of availability" means no active website, brand, or active business returned for the exact name. "Parked for sale" and "active brand" are flagged separately. All assessments are dated 21 February 2026 and are pre-clearance only.

---

## Full Candidate Longlist (25–30 names)

Organised by territory. The domain signal column summarises search findings.

### Territory A — Place-rooted, Non-Trapping

Names that evoke the Amalfi/Southern Italian coast through atmosphere rather than literal place-names.

| # | Candidate | Phonetics (EN speaker) | Construction | Domain signal |
|---|-----------|----------------------|--------------|---------------|
| A1 | **Spolvera** | spol-VAY-ra | From Italian "spolvero" (dusting/light application; also a historical craft tracing technique); final -a feminised | No brand or .com found — zero hits on brand search; purely craft-term territory |
| A2 | **Pontevi** | pon-TEH-vee | Invented: evokes "ponte" (bridge) + coastal suffix; no direct Italian word | No brand or .com found — zero hits; "pontevi" returns no brand results; "ponte" brands exist separately |
| A3 | **Gravina** | gra-VEE-na | Real Italian surname and Puglian town (Gravina in Puglia) | Domain likely registered (Italian surname); Gravina Windows/Law firm in US; collision risk medium-high |
| A4 | **Corvina** | kor-VEE-na | Italian word (grape variety; also a fish); poetic coastal resonance | No active brand domain at corvina.com — used as a product name by Faithfull the Brand and jewellery; no standalone brand |

### Territory B — Craft and Material Language

Names derived from Italian craft techniques or material characteristics, feminised or coined.

| # | Candidate | Phonetics (EN speaker) | Construction | Domain signal |
|---|-----------|----------------------|--------------|---------------|
| B1 | **Spolvera** *(also A1)* | spol-VAY-ra | "Spolvero" craft technique (dusting of pigment through a perforated pattern) — used in Renaissance fresco technique; signals precision craft | Zero brand results |
| B2 | **Livorni** | lee-VOR-nee | Invented: evokes Livorno (Tuscan port) + artisan plural suffix; sounds like a craftsman name | Zero brand or .com results |
| B3 | **Rifilo** | ree-FEE-lo | Italian: "rifilo" = edge-trimming in leather/bookbinding; direct craft term | Appeared in Round 1 as a candidate — listed here for completeness; descriptiveness TM risk |

### Territory C — Coined Word with Italian Phonetics (Primary Territory)

Invented marks with Italian mouth-feel. Maximum distinctiveness and ownability. Bias strongly here.

| # | Candidate | Phonetics (EN speaker) | Construction | Domain signal |
|---|-----------|----------------------|--------------|---------------|
| C1 | **Torvina** | tor-VEE-na | tor- (evokes Torre/Torcello, stone/light) + -vina (wine-adjacent warmth); fully coined | No brand, no .com — Etsy has one listing with the word as a garment detail name, no standalone brand |
| C2 | **Selvona** | sel-VOH-na | sel- (light/threshold feel) + -vona (invented Italian-pattern suffix); fully coined | Zero brand or .com results found; clean slate |
| C3 | **Tolvina** | tol-VEE-na | tol- (invented) + -vina (wine/vine warmth); fully coined | Zero brand or .com results found |
| C4 | **Caleva** | ka-LAY-va | cal- (warmth/heat: "calore") + -eva (light biblical-Italian feminisation); coined | No caleva.com brand found; "Caleesa" handbag brand is phonetically adjacent but distinct |
| C5 | **Colvara** | kol-VAR-a | col- (hill: "colle") + -vara (river/place evocation); coined | Colvara.store is a hair treatment brand — .com may differ; surname use (Brazilian) |
| C6 | **Torvia** | TOR-vee-a | tor- (tower/stone) + -via (way/route); compact and evocative | torvia.shop exists (home goods brand); torvia.com status uncertain |
| C7 | **Pontevi** *(also A2)* | pon-TEH-vee | Coined bridge+suffix | Zero brand results — strong candidate |
| C8 | **Elvoria** | el-VOR-ee-a | el- (light-adjacent in Romance) + -voria (invented); | elvoria.com is for sale on BrandBucket (premium listed); Elvoria London (Dutch dropshipper with poor reputation) on different domain; TM risk low if .com purchase feasible |
| C9 | **Ardina** | ar-DEE-na | ard- (heat, gold feel: "ardore") + -ina (diminutive warmth); coined | No fashion brand at ardina.com found; Ardina Car Care exists; person-name connotation moderate |
| C10 | **Livorni** *(also B2)* | lee-VOR-nee | — | Zero brand/domain results |
| C11 | **Noleva** | no-LAY-va | no- (south, Italian "novo") + -leva (lever/lift; evokes elevation); coined | Not yet searched — no prior results in either round |
| C12 | **Verniva** | ver-NEE-va | ver- (spring: "primavera" root) + -niva (invented Slavic-Italian hybrid that reads Italian); coined | Not searched — no prior results |
| C13 | **Sorbena** | sor-BAY-na | sor- (sun-sister: "sorella" + "sole") + -bena (Italianate invented suffix); coined | Not searched — clean phonetic |

### Territory D — Emotion or Quality

Single Italian words or near-words with immediate emotional resonance.

| # | Candidate | Phonetics (EN speaker) | Construction | Domain signal |
|---|-----------|----------------------|--------------|---------------|
| D1 | **Incanto** | in-KAN-toh | Italian: "enchantment/spell" — warm, feminine, expansive | Round 1 candidate — listed for reference; medium-high collision risk |
| D2 | **Vigore** | vee-GOR-ay | Italian: "vigour/force" — strong, confident, unusual for accessories | Not specifically searched; "vigore" is a real Italian word; possible descriptiveness risk |
| D3 | **Valore** | va-LOR-ay | Italian: "value/worth" — instantly legible, aspirational | Likely registered; common Italian word in brand territory |

### Territory E — Paired Words / Compounds

| # | Candidate | Phonetics (EN speaker) | Construction | Domain signal |
|---|-----------|----------------------|--------------|---------------|
| E1 | **MareFilo** | ma-ray-FEE-lo | "sea + thread" — craft meets coast; compound | Not searched specifically; crowded compound territory |

## Ranked Shortlist — Top 8 Names (Domain Appears Available or Uncontested)

These eight names carry the highest combined score across distinctiveness, Italian phonetic quality, English-speaker accessibility, expansion headroom, domain availability signal, and TM ownability trajectory. All require professional TM clearance and domain verification before any filing or registration.

### Scoring criteria (same scale as Round 1)

- **Spectrum:** coined / suggestive / descriptive
- **Core strength:** primary brand-building asset
- **Primary risk:** the main vulnerability
- **Domain risk:** current signal from web search (21 Feb 2026)
- **TM risk:** inference only — not a substitute for legal clearance

---

### Rank 1 — Pontevi

| Field | Assessment |
|-------|-----------|
| Territory | C — coined Italian phonetics |
| Spectrum | Coined |
| Core strength | Zero existing brand equity to compete with; bridge/connect connotation without literal naming; compact (7 letters, 3 syllables); reads as Italian artisan studio name; expansion-ready |
| Primary risk | Meaning must be built entirely from scratch; "ponte" root is not exclusive but distinctly coded to Italy |
| Domain risk | Low — zero active brand or website found for "pontevi"; not a dictionary word; no HugeDomains/BrandBucket listing found |
| TM risk | Low-medium — coined; unlikely to conflict in Class 18/14; "Ponte" variants exist (Marta Ponti) but "Pontevi" is distinct |
| Notes | Strongest overall candidate in this round. Compact, ownable, European-legible, and completely clear in web searches. |

---

### Rank 2 — Spolvera

| Field | Assessment |
|-------|-----------|
| Territory | A/B hybrid — craft technique, non-trapping place atmosphere |
| Spectrum | Suggestive (craft-term adjacent) |
| Core strength | "Spolvero" is a real Renaissance craft technique (dusting pigment through perforated cartoon onto fresco substrate) — gives the brand a genuine story anchor; ends in -a (feminine Italian); Italian artisan heritage implied without being literal |
| Primary risk | "Spolvero" is a real Italian dictionary word; EUIPO may argue descriptiveness for craft/leather goods if the term is perceived as describing a product process; requires legal opinion |
| Domain risk | Low — no brand, no website, no domain listing found for "spolvera" anywhere; name appears genuinely unclaimed |
| TM risk | Medium — real Italian word creates descriptiveness risk in EU classes; stronger in UK/US where the word is unknown to most consumers |
| Notes | The craft backstory is the strongest of any name in both rounds. If TM is clearable, this is the most storytelling-rich option. |

---

### Rank 3 — Torvina

| Field | Assessment |
|-------|-----------|
| Territory | C — coined Italian phonetics |
| Spectrum | Coined |
| Core strength | tor- root evokes Torre (tower) and Torcello (Venetian island); -vina suffix has wine-warmth; compact (7 letters); feels like a small Italian maker's mark |
| Primary risk | "Tor" prefix is common in Italian brand names; some collision risk with other Tor- brands in broader fashion |
| Domain risk | Low-medium — no standalone brand at torvina.com; only one Etsy listing uses it as a garment detail descriptor |
| TM risk | Low — coined; no active competing fashion mark found |
| Notes | Very similar phonetic quality to Round 1's Cintara. Second strongest coined candidate after Pontevi. |

---

### Rank 4 — Selvona

| Field | Assessment |
|-------|-----------|
| Territory | C — coined Italian phonetics |
| Spectrum | Coined |
| Core strength | Sel- evokes "selvatico" (wild, untamed) and "selvaggio" (the wild coastal edge) without being that word; -vona is an invented Italian-pattern suffix; distinctive and slightly unexpected |
| Primary risk | "Sel-" root may read as French (sel = salt) to some buyers — cross-language ambiguity; |
| Domain risk | Low — zero brand or .com results found |
| TM risk | Low — coined mark; good ownability trajectory |
| Notes | Most distinctive phonetically of the shorter coined candidates. The French-salt reading could actually be an asset (dual-coding for French tourist market on the coast). |

---

### Rank 5 — Tolvina

| Field | Assessment |
|-------|-----------|
| Territory | C — coined Italian phonetics |
| Spectrum | Coined |
| Core strength | Fully invented; no semantic risk; -vina suffix gives wine-warmth and Italian femininity; 7 letters |
| Primary risk | Tol- root is thin on Italian associations — requires stronger brand story to anchor it |
| Domain risk | Low — zero brand or .com results found |
| TM risk | Low — coined; clean slate |
| Notes | Solid backup if Pontevi or Torvina are unavailable. Lower phonetic distinctiveness than the top three. |

---

### Rank 6 — Caleva

| Field | Assessment |
|-------|-----------|
| Territory | C — coined Italian phonetics |
| Spectrum | Coined (borderline suggestive) |
| Core strength | cal- from "calore" (warmth/heat) — the warmth of the Amalfi sun is implicit; -eva suffix sounds Italianate-Mediterranean; 6 letters; very registerable length |
| Primary risk | "Caleesa" handbag brand is phonetically adjacent (though distinct); some confusion risk at discovery stage |
| Domain risk | Low — no active caleva.com brand found |
| TM risk | Low-medium — coined, but cal- root adjacency to Cala brands (Cala Jade) needs checking |
| Notes | Most compact name in the shortlist (6 letters). Excellent for wordmarks. Slightly less distinctive phonetically than top three. |

---

### Rank 7 — Livorni

| Field | Assessment |
|-------|-----------|
| Territory | B/C hybrid — place-evocative craft suffix |
| Spectrum | Coined (place-evocative) |
| Core strength | Evokes Livorno (Tuscan port, historically significant for Mediterranean trade leather) + artisan plural suffix -i; sounds like a generational maker's studio name; expands naturally to "Casa Livorni," "Atelier Livorni" |
| Primary risk | Livorno is a real and somewhat industrially-coded city — less romantic than Amalfi; requires narrative to reframe; Italian consumers may have strong existing associations |
| Domain risk | Low — zero brand or .com results found |
| TM risk | Medium — place-evocative names carry clearance risk in EU (geographical indications); EUIPO may reject if perceived as a geographical descriptor, though "Livorni" as a coined plural is likely sufficiently distinct |
| Notes | Best expansion-ready name in the list. "Livorni" as a brand family (Livorni No.1, Livorni Piccola, etc.) has Polène-style potential. |

---

### Rank 8 — Corvina

| Field | Assessment |
|-------|-----------|
| Territory | A — place-rooted, non-trapping |
| Spectrum | Suggestive |
| Core strength | Corvina is an Italian word with multiple rich readings: the Corvina grape (Veneto wine country), a dark-feathered bird (corvid), and a Mediterranean fish — all carry an earthy, artisan Italian resonance without being literally coastal or descriptive for leather goods |
| Primary risk | Real Italian word increases descriptiveness risk; used as a product name by Faithfull the Brand (dress) and at least one jeweller; may create search noise |
| Domain risk | Medium — corvina.com not confirmed available; no active brand found at that domain, but the word is common enough that a parking registrant is plausible |
| TM risk | Medium — real Italian word; check EUIPO Classes 18/14/25 carefully |
| Notes | The phonetically richest name in the shortlist. If corvina.com is genuinely unregistered, this is a tier-1 candidate. Verify domain before proceeding. |

## Summary Scoring Table

| Rank | Name | Territory | Spectrum | Core Strength | Primary Risk | Domain Risk | TM Risk |
|------|------|-----------|----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Pontevi | C — coined | Coined | Ownable, bridge connotation, clean slate | Brand story must be built from zero | Low | Low-medium |
| 2 | Spolvera | A/B — craft | Suggestive | Rich Renaissance craft backstory | Descriptiveness risk in EU (real Italian word) | Low | Medium |
| 3 | Torvina | C — coined | Coined | Torre/Torcello evocation, wine warmth | Common Tor- prefix in Italian brands | Low-medium | Low |
| 4 | Selvona | C — coined | Coined | "Wild coastal edge" without literalism; unexpected | Possible French cross-read (sel = salt) | Low | Low |
| 5 | Tolvina | C — coined | Coined | Clean coined mark; -vina warmth | Thin Italian root associations | Low | Low |
| 6 | Caleva | C — coined | Coined (borderline) | Warmth/calore evocation; 6 letters | Caleesa adjacency; cal- brand proximity | Low | Low-medium |
| 7 | Livorni | B/C — place-craft | Coined (place-evocative) | Generational studio name feel; expansion headroom | Livorno associations; EU geographical TM risk | Low | Medium |
| 8 | Corvina | A — place-rooted | Suggestive | Multiple Italian word readings; earthy artisan resonance | Real Italian word; product-name search noise | Medium | Medium |

## Recommended Territory for Round 2

Confirmed: **coined word with Italian phonetics (Territory C)**, same as Round 1, with Spolvera as a strong Territory B crossover given its craft-story richness.

The recommendation ranking order for operator decision:

1. **Pontevi** — register for verification first; cleanest domain signal, most ownable
2. **Spolvera** — highest storytelling potential; get TM opinion on descriptiveness before investing
3. **Torvina** — strong backup to Pontevi if domain unavailable
4. **Selvona** — distinct and unexpected; good if brand wants a slightly more abstract register

---

## Next Steps

1. Run WHOIS verification on pontevi.com, spolvera.com, torvina.com, selvona.com, tolvina.com before any filing
2. Commission TM clearance search in Classes 14, 18, 25 (EUIPO + UK IPO + USPTO) for top 2–3 candidates
3. Linguistic review for top 2 names: check for negative connotations in Italian, French, German, Japanese, and English
4. Operator selects 1 name → proceed to branding brief and `/lp-do-plan`

---

## Evidence Notes

Domain signals were gathered via web search on 21 February 2026. These are not WHOIS checks and are not definitive. A name showing "zero brand results" in web search may still be a registered domain with no content or with minimal indexing. All domain availability claims should be verified with a live WHOIS query before any business commitment.

TM risk estimates are inferences based on EUIPO distinctiveness principles and publicly available search results. They are not legal advice and do not substitute for professional clearance.
