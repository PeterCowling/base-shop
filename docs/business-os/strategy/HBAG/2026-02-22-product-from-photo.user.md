1) PRODUCT FAMILY OVERVIEW (for Product Dev / Marketing / Sales)

Product family name (provisional if not shown): Caryina "Mini Facade Micro Bag" (PROVISIONAL) (Name not shown in images; provisional working name.) (Evidence: Image 1, no branding/label visible anywhere in frame.)

Product type/category: APPARENT: structured micro handbag-shaped accessory / micro tote silhouette; UNKNOWN: whether intended as bag charm vs standalone micro bag (no scale reference, no product label). (Evidence: Image 4, full front; Image 14, full back.)

One-paragraph plain-language description:
OBSERVED: A structured, top-handle micro bag with a strap-style front closure using a turn-lock style metal clasp, plus side gussets that create a trapezoid profile. Some variants include a stitched multi-layer "building facade" applique with three arched window motifs on the front panel. Exterior surfaces vary by colorway, including metallic embossed texture, croc-emboss with pink splatter coloration, and pebbled grain. (Evidence: Image 4, front view with clasp + facade; Image 9, back view showing croc-emboss + splatter; Image 14, back view showing pebbled grain.)

Key differentiators (evidence-locked):

OBSERVED: Turn-lock style clasp integrated into a front strap closure. (Evidence: Image 4, upper front center; Image 5, upper side/front hardware.)

OBSERVED: Structured silhouette with fixed side gussets forming a triangular/trapezoid side profile. (Evidence: Image 1, left side profile; Image 13, left side profile.)

OBSERVED: Two short top handles with stitched attachment tabs. (Evidence: Image 2, top/handle area; Image 12, top/handle area.)

OBSERVED (variant-controlled): Three-arched-window "facade" applique present on some variants. (Evidence: Image 4, lower front; Image 11, lower front.)

OBSERVED: Multiple exterior texture/finish executions across colorways (metallic reptile-scale emboss; croc-style emboss; pebbled grain). (Evidence: Image 4, metallic emboss; Image 9, croc emboss; Image 14, pebbled grain.)

APPARENT (accessory, not confirmed pack-out): A patterned fabric scarf/strap is tied around the handles in some photos. (Evidence: Image 2, handle wrap; Image 9, handle wrap.)

Target users/contexts: UNKNOWN (no packaging copy, label, or text shown). (Evidence: All images—no readable product text.)

2) MASTER MANUFACTURING SPEC (for Production)
2.1 Architecture / Component Breakdown

Family-common architecture (OBSERVED/INFERRED from geometry):

Main bag body shell: front panel + back panel + left/right side gussets forming a structured trapezoid profile. (Evidence: Image 4, front; Image 2, back; Image 1, side.)

Top opening with flap/strap closure system: front strap crosses the top-front area and mates to a turn-lock style clasp assembly. (Evidence: Image 4, upper front; Image 5, upper hardware.)

Top handle set: two short handles mounted at the top edge via stitched tabs. (Evidence: Image 2, handles; Image 12, handles.)

Perimeter edge finishing: contrasting piping/binding/edge-welt appearance around gusset edges and top perimeter (construction method not confirmed). (Evidence: Image 1, gusset edge; Image 8, gusset edge close-up.)

Variant-controlled assemblies:

Exterior surface material/texture + base color execution (metallic reptile emboss vs croc emboss with splatter vs pebbled grain). (Evidence: Image 4 vs Image 9 vs Image 14.)

Decorative facade applique system (presence + colors): present on V1 and V3; not shown for V2. (Evidence: Image 4; Image 11; Image 5–10 show no front view for V2.)

Bottom/base strip color treatment: grey vs green vs not clearly separated. (Evidence: Image 4 bottom edge; Image 12 bottom edge; Image 9 bottom edge.)

Interior/top-edge visible lining treatment: clear glossy layer visible on V3; not visible on V1/V2. (Evidence: Image 11, top opening.)

2.9 Manufacturing Notes & Risk Flags (for Product Development + Production)

P0 ambiguity: Interior construction, lining material, and whether V3 clear glossy layer is a permanent lining vs removable protective film. Impacts BOM + assembly + compliance. (Evidence: Image 11, top opening glossy layer.)

P0 ambiguity: Hardware finish on V3 appears mixed silver/gold, while other variants appear gold-tone; could be reflection. Needs confirmation to avoid finish mismatch. (Evidence: Image 11, clasp close-up vs Image 4, clasp close-up.)

P0 ambiguity: No visible charm attachment hardware (clip/carabiner/keyring). If this is intended as a "bag charm," attachment interface is not documented by photos. (Evidence: All images—no clip/hook shown.)

P1 risk: Decorative facade applique has multiple aligned layers; misregistration and stitch quality are visually prominent in close-ups. (Evidence: Image 4, facade; Image 11, facade.)

P1 risk: Bottom/base strip differs by variant (grey vs green); ensure controlled color spec and placement symmetry. (Evidence: Image 12, green base strip; Image 4, grey base strip.)

P2 risk: V2 front view not provided; cannot confirm if facade applique is present or if it is a "plain" execution. Impacts SKU/variant definitions. (Evidence: Images 5–10 show only sides/back/top.)

7) UNKNOWNS & REQUIRED IMAGERY (actionable capture list)

P0 (blocking): Overall dimensions (H × W × D) + scale reference

Missing detail: true size and proportions.

Why it matters: Production (pattern sizing), Dev (component sizing), Sales (product listing).

Exact photo needed: front + side + top shots with a ruler or measuring tape in frame; neutral background; camera square-on.

P0 (blocking): Interior construction + lining confirmation

Missing detail: interior material, seams, pocket/compartment (if any), and whether V3 clear glossy layer is lining vs protective film.

Why it matters: BOM, assembly steps, cost, QC.

Exact photo needed: bag fully opened, shot directly down into interior with strong diffuse light; macro of inside corners and top-edge finish.

P0 (blocking): "Bag charm" attachment interface (if intended)

Missing detail: any clip/carabiner/keyring/D-ring attachment point.

Why it matters: functional requirement, packaging copy, and compatibility claims.

Exact photo needed: full bag photographed showing any attachment hardware; macro of the attachment point; include where it mounts to the bag body.

P1 (important): Hardware finish confirmation (especially V3 clasp plate)

Missing detail: plating/finish (gold vs mixed silver/gold) and whether finish differs by variant.

Why it matters: purchasing, QC, avoiding mixed plating in production.

Exact photo needed: macro close-up of clasp and keeper bars under neutral indoor lighting (no strong reflections), plus a second shot at 45° angle.

P1 (important): V2 front panel view

Missing detail: whether facade applique exists on V2 and if so, palette details.

Exact photo needed: straight-on front photo of V2 on neutral background, plus close-up of any applique.

P2 (nice-to-have): Materials verification via label/packaging

Missing detail: material composition, care info, brand name, country of origin.

Why it matters: listing compliance and accurate claims.

Exact photo needed: any hangtag/label/packaging text; close-up readable photo.

8) COMPLETENESS CHECKLIST (self-audit before finalizing)

Controlled attributes: Every attribute listed in Section 3 includes allowed values, evidence references, and variant mapping (with "not observed" used only to reflect missing viewpoints, not to assert absence).

Variant-defining differences captured: Exterior colorway, texture, edge color, facade palette/presence, bottom strip color, hardware finish appearance, and top-edge lining visibility are all represented in the variation table and used in the variant roster.

No unverified dimensions/materials stated as fact: All materials are marked UNKNOWN with optional APPARENT appearance notes; no dimensions are asserted.

Conflicts flagged: Hardware finish on V3 is flagged as CONFLICT RISK and a resolution photo is specified.

Cross-consistency check: All variant-defining differences in Section 4 are sourced from the controlled variation table in Section 3, and all Section 3 values are referenced by at least one variant in Section 4.
