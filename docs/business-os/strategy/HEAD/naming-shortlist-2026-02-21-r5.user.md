# HEAD Naming Shortlist — Round 5 (2026-02-21)

## Score key

| Column | Meaning | What a 5 looks like |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| **D** | Distinctiveness — TM ownability, not confusable with competitors | Fully invented, no phonetic cousin in the category |
| **W** | Wordmark quality — works as a stamped logo, Instagram handle | 7–12 letters, strong visual rhythm, memorable in caps |
| **P** | Phonetics — smooth to say in both IT and EN | Flows naturally in IT + EN, soft vowels |
| **E** | Expansion headroom — works beyond the initial product | Non-product-specific; fits any CI lifestyle accessory |
| **I** | ICP resonance — Italian CI caregiver parent stops scrolling | Immediately feels warm, practical, non-clinical |
| **Score** | Sum of D + W + P + E + I | Max 25 |

## Note on Pattern E (available but not in top 20)

Three pattern E real Italian words are available as .com domains: Allestita (rank 6), Dotazione (score 23), Abitudine (score 22). Allestita is included in the top 20 as it scores 25 and sits comfortably in the organiser/kit register. The others are common enough Italian words that TM registration in IT/EU would face a higher bar than the coined names.

## Spec changes this round

Round 5 introduced: complete territory redesign from aesthetic-vibe territories to situation-anchored, semantic-type-differentiated territories (§4.3). New morpheme pools aligned with product situations (ferm-, sald-, pront-, port-, indoss-, vest-, solit-, agil-, snell-, scatt-, segn-, firm-). Collapse prevention gate added to spec (§4.0) with three mandatory pre-generation tests. Pattern D hard-blocked. All 250 Round 4 candidates eliminated in §5.4.

## Next step

Operator reviews top 20. To select a name, say which one. To reject and try again, say "none of these work" — optionally tell me why and I'll encode it as a constraint for Round 6.
