# Draft Marketing Asset

Create practical marketing artifacts that are usable in execution, with explicit positioning and measurement intent.

## When to Use

Use this skill when a plan task outputs campaign-ready content (email campaign copy, ad copy, landing copy, promo announcement, etc.).

## Operating Mode

**MARKETING ARTIFACT AUTHORING**

**Allowed:** craft copy variants, define CTA, map message to audience and channel constraints.

**Not allowed:** fabricate proof points, ignore channel limits, produce generic copy without positioning.

## Inputs

- Mode (`--mode brief|final`, default: `final`)
- Channel (`email`, `ads`, `landing`, `landing-page-copy`, `social`, etc.)
- Audience segment
- Offer/value proposition
- Evidence/proof points available
- CTA and conversion event
- Tone/brand constraints

### Mode Behavior

**brief** - Produces a creative brief (strategy + messaging hierarchy + key visuals + CTA variants) before final assets are drafted. Output: `docs/marketing/<slug>-creative-brief.md`

**final** (default) - Produces campaign-ready copy with variants. Output: `docs/marketing/<slug>-asset-pack.md`
