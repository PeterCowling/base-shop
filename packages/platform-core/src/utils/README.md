# Utility Functions

Shared helpers for platform-core.

- `fillLocales(values, fallback)` â€“ ensure all supported locales have a value,
  falling back when missing.

For general-purpose helpers like `slugify` and `genSecret`, see
`@acme/shared-utils`.

These utilities are re-exported from the `@acme/platform-core` package root for
easy consumption.
