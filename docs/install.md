# Installation

Requires **Node.js >=20**, **pnpm 10.12.1**, and a `DATABASE_URL` pointing to your
PostgreSQL instance. See [setup](./setup.md) for full setup and CI guidance.

Create a `.env` file with your database connection string and apply migrations
before starting:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/shop"
```

```bash
pnpm --filter @acme/platform-core exec prisma migrate dev
pnpm --filter @acme/platform-core run prisma:generate
pnpm --filter @acme/platform-core exec prisma db seed
```

### Seeding

`pnpm prisma db seed` loads both inventory and orders, pulling inventory fixtures from `data/shops/*/inventory.json`.

To skip loading inventory, run:

```bash
pnpm prisma db seed -- --skip-inventory
```

`--skip-inventory` replaces the old `SKIP_INVENTORY_SEED` environment variable.

`postinstall` runs `prisma generate` automatically.

If `DATABASE_URL` is unset, the platform falls back to an in-memory test stub.

## Getting Started

To scaffold a shop and immediately start the dev server in one step:

```bash
pnpm quickstart-shop --id demo --theme base --template template-app --auto-plugins --auto-env --presets
```

This wraps the `init-shop` configurator, validates the generated `.env`, and runs `pnpm dev` for the new shop. `--auto-plugins` selects all detected payment and shipping providers, `--auto-env` writes placeholder environment variables, and `--presets` applies default navigation, pages, and a GitHub Actions workflow. You can also provide a configuration file and skip most flags:

```bash
pnpm quickstart-shop --config ./shop.config.json
```

Example `shop.config.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "demo",
  "theme": "base",
  "template": "template-app",
  "payment": ["stripe"],
  "shipping": ["ups"],
  "navItems": [{ "label": "Home", "href": "/" }],
  "pages": [{ "slug": "about", "title": "About Us" }]
}
```

1. **Initialize a shop**

   ```bash
   pnpm init-shop
   # optionally generate a GitHub Actions workflow
   pnpm setup-ci <id>
   ```

   `init-shop` launches an interactive configurator that asks for the shop ID, display name, logo URL,
   contact email, shop type (`sale` or `rental`), and which theme and template to use. Payment and
   shipping providers are chosen from guided lists of available providers. It then
   scaffolds `apps/shop-<id>` and prompts for environment variables like Stripe keys and CMS
   credentials, writing them directly to `apps/shop-<id>/.env` and generating a matching
   `.env.template` with the required keys. The configurator validates the environment immediately and
   can fetch secrets from an external vault by providing `--vault-cmd <cmd>` (the command is invoked
   with each variable name). For scripted setups you can still
   call `pnpm create-shop <id>` and pass flags like `--name`, `--logo` and `--contact` to skip those
   prompts. Both `init-shop` and `create-shop` accept a `--seed` flag to copy sample
   `products.json` and `inventory.json` from `data/templates/default` into the new shop.
   To reuse answers, place a JSON profile in `profiles/<name>.json` and run
   `pnpm init-shop --profile <name>`. Combine with `--skip-prompts` to accept
   defaults for any remaining questions and run non-interactively.

   ```bash
   pnpm create-shop <id> --name="Demo Shop" --logo=https://example.com/logo.png \
     --contact=demo@example.com
   ```

2. **Run the app**

   ```bash
   cd apps/shop-<id>
   pnpm dev
   ```

   The configurator already validated your environment variables. Rerun `pnpm validate-env <id>` after
   editing `.env` if you need to re-check. Open http://localhost:3000 to view the site. Pages
   hot-reload on save.

   If `pnpm dev` fails with an `array.length` error, run the relevant Codex command to inspect detailed logs explaining the failure.

3. _(Optional)_ Each Next.js app must provide its own `postcss.config.cjs` that forwards to the repo root configuration so Tailwind resolves correctly. After updating Tailwind or any CSS utilities, run `pnpm tailwind:check` to verify the build.

### Example

```bash
pnpm init-shop
? Shop ID … demo
? Display name … Demo Shop
? Logo URL … https://example.com/logo.png
? Contact email … demo@example.com
? Shop type (sale or rental) … sale
? Theme › base
? Template › template-app
Available payment providers:
  1) stripe
  2) paypal
Select payment providers by number (comma-separated, empty for none): 1
Available shipping providers:
  1) dhl
  2) ups
Select shipping providers by number (comma-separated, empty for none): 2
Scaffolded apps/shop-demo

Deploy
The project is CI-deployed to Cloudflare Pages via

## Svelte integration

This repo includes a minimal example plugin located at `packages/svelte-tool`.
The plugin is registered via `svelte.config.ts` and uses the
`vite-plugin-svelte` Node plugin installed as a dev dependency.

To experiment with Svelte:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

## Storybook

See [storybook](./storybook.md) for details on running Storybook,
executing accessibility tests and publishing Chromatic previews.

## CMS Guide

See [CMS guide](./cms.md) for an overview of the CMS navigation,
switching shops and admin-only routes. Newcomers can follow the
[Page Builder](./cms.md#page-builder) section to learn how to add,
rearrange and publish blocks.

### Theme overrides

The CMS theme editor lets admins customize design tokens per shop. Tokens are
grouped by purpose (Background, Text, Accent) and each color token displays a
preview swatch. Clicking a swatch focuses its corresponding field, where a color
picker enables quick overrides. Save the form to persist any changes. For a deeper look at base themes, overrides, persistence and live preview, see [docs/theming-advanced.md](docs/theming-advanced.md).

### Device presets

The Page Builder and `/edit-preview` route include a device menu with presets for:

- Desktop 1280
- Desktop 1440
- iPad
- iPad Pro
- iPhone SE
- iPhone 12
- Galaxy S8

Switch between widths using the desktop/tablet/mobile buttons or the dropdown. The chosen preset resets to **Desktop 1280** when the page reloads.
