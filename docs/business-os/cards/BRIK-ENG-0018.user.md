# Dashboard Upgrade Aggregator

**Source:** Migrated from `dashboard-upgrade-aggregator-plan.md`


# Dashboard Upgrade Aggregator

Goal: consolidate a single dynamic interface (table + filters + drill-in modal) for monitoring/managing room upgrades during check-in at the desk, across all houses, replacing the current multi-sheet spreadsheet workflow.

Priority: immediate-term (~2 weeks)

Status: Draft

The scope is intentionally narrow: desk agents can see cross-property upgrade states and mark an upgrade offered / accepted / declined in real time. No automation, guest upsell screen, or payment integration in this phase.
