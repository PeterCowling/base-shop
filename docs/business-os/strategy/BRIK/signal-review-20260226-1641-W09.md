| P08 | Feedback Loop Closure | 4 | 5 | 2026-02-13-weekly-kpcs-decision.user.md — only readout; 13 days elapsed; day-14 gate review due 2026-02-27 | Yes |
| P09 | Checkpointed Restartability | 4 | 5 | All paths checked; demand-evidence-pack resolved; deferred stages (S2B/S6B) are intentional per scorecard §D | No |
| P10 | Human Judgment Gates | 3 | 3 | prioritization-scorecard.user.md (Owner: Pete; no Human-approved field — convention gap, not run-validity threat per P10 special handling) | No |

**P09 intentionally deferred (not violations — stages not started):**
- `docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/*offer*.user.md` (S2B — deferred per prioritization-scorecard §D)
- `docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/messaging-hierarchy.user.md` (S2B — index.user.md Status: —)
- `docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/*channel*.user.md` (S6B — deferred per prioritization-scorecard §D)

**Evidence notes:**
- P01: Four artifacts reviewed. plan.user.md (Strategy → risks structure); forecast v1 (observed anchor / assumption labels throughout); demand-evidence-pack (DEP record before conclusions, macro context before gate assessments); weekly-kpcs (Section A = data, Section B = decision). Evidence-then-synthesis pattern is consistent across all four. Support=4.
- P02: Forecast v1 assumption register uses narrative labels (Medium, Low-Medium, Medium-Low) — not numeric per-dimension scores. No "what would raise this to >=80%" actions defined. Prioritization scorecard has numeric 0–5 per criterion but that is a prioritization rubric, not a confidence calibration. Pattern unchanged since W08. Support=3.
- P03: plan.user.md has four named, specific risks (Measurement Signal Quality, Booking Attribution Gap, Translation Quality, Reception App Stability) with specific mitigations. None are generic. No /lp-do-critique reference found in plan, forecast, or scorecard. Absence clearly confirmed. Risk section quality partially satisfies the spirit of this principle. Support=4.
- P04: measurement-verification.user.md (dated 2026-02-13) still shows begin_checkout=0 and web_vitals=0 in the locked 7-day GA4 extract. brikette-cta-sales-funnel-ga4 plan shipped 2026-02-22 and confirmed funnel firing via Playwright smoke test — but NO updated measurement-verification.user.md exists with a refreshed locked window showing non-zero begin_checkout in report output. KPCS action item "Re-run GA4 extraction and lock refreshed 7-day baseline" is not completed. Forecast CVR assumptions (1.6%–2.1%) remain labeled "assumption (to be measured)". Day-14 validation thresholds (CVR ≥1.6%, sessions ≥5,000) cannot be evaluated. Historical booking anchors (1,906 bookings, EUR 514,800.23) are real and traceable. Support=4.
- P05: startup-loop/SKILL.md — "ORCHESTRATE + GATE + HANDOFF" operating mode; routes to lp-* executor skills; no stage-specific execution logic. Unchanged from W08. Support=5.
- P06: prioritization-scorecard.user.md — one deliverable per item with named pass criteria (e.g., "p75 <=2.5s for 7 consecutive days", ">=90% cancellations coded"). No IMPLEMENT task format with Deliverable field. Scope is adequately contained for the current stage of the run. Support=3.
- P07: startup-loop/SKILL.md dispatch uses --biz and --run-root parameters. Forecast v1 source list references inputs by path. No inline embedding of full prior-stage content found. Support=3.
- P08: One weekly readout exists (2026-02-13). As of 2026-02-26, 13 days have elapsed with no second readout. Five KPCS action items (begin_checkout fix, GA4 baseline refresh, policy/fee clarity, cancellation coding, day-14 gate review) have no documented outcome record. The forecast recalibration artifact is targeted for 2026-02-27 (`docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/2026-02-27-forecast-recalibration.user.md`) — cannot be produced without a measurement baseline. Directory scan of BRIK strategy directory confirms a single `*kpcs*.user.md` artifact. Support=5.
- P09: All canonical stage artifact paths checked. demand-evidence-pack.md now at canonical path (RESOLVED from W08, Status: Active). All completed stages (S1 brand dossier, S2 demand evidence, S2A measurement verification, S3 forecast, S4 prioritization, S10 weekly readout) have Active artifacts. Deferred stages (S2B offer/messaging, S6B channel) are explicitly documented in prioritization-scorecard §D. The brik-ga4-baseline-lock plan reference in KPCS has been clarified: measurement-verification.user.md is the canonical checkpoint. Support=5.
- P10: prioritization-scorecard.user.md (Owner: Pete, no Human-approved field). weekly-kpcs-decision.user.md (Decision: Continue, owner implied by "Pete" throughout — no ## Human Decisions This Week section). S2B/S6B stage artifacts missing → defer to P09 per P10 special handling. Per P10 note: convention gap only; operator identity (Pete) is clear throughout all artifacts. Severity=3/Support=3 (below finding threshold). Support=3.

## Top Findings

### Finding 1: Ground Truth Anchoring — day-14 gate cannot be evaluated; refreshed GA4 baseline still absent

- Fingerprint: `P04-S2A-conversion-signal-zero-no-real-cvr-anchor`
- Severity: 5
- Support: 4
- Stage(s) affected: S2A (measurement verification), S3 (forecast)
- Failure indicator: The locked 7-day GA4 measurement baseline in measurement-verification.user.md still shows begin_checkout=0 and web_vitals=0 (dated 2026-02-13); no refreshed extract has been locked post-deployment of brikette-cta-sales-funnel-ga4; forecast CVR assumptions (1.6–2.1%) remain labeled "assumption (to be measured)" with no measured anchor
- Evidence pointer: `docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/2026-02-13-measurement-verification.user.md` §6 (Data API Status, begin_checkout: 0); `docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/2026-02-13-startup-loop-90-day-forecast-v1.user.md` §2 (Blended CVR: "assumption (to be measured)")
- Status: REPEAT (new evidence: brikette-cta-sales-funnel-ga4 shipped 2026-02-22 and confirmed funnel firing in production via Playwright smoke test — but the KPCS action item "Re-run GA4 extraction and lock refreshed 7-day baseline" was not completed, and the day-14 gate review is now due tomorrow 2026-02-27)

**Why this matters**: The day-14 validation plan (forecast §4) requires CVR ≥ 1.6% with ≥ 5,000 sessions and begin_checkout non-zero in a locked report window. That gate is due tomorrow (2026-02-27) and the forecast recalibration artifact is targeted for the same date. Without a refreshed GA4 extract confirming non-zero begin_checkout in the report layer (not just in live click-path probes), the day-14 gate cannot be conducted, the recalibration artifact has no measured basis, and all guardrails in the run contract (CVR <1.2% → hold spend; CAC >EUR 130 → retargeting-only) remain operationally blind. The funnel code is confirmed live — the gap is purely the report-layer measurement extraction and the locked baseline document.

Fingerprint: `P04-S2A-conversion-signal-zero-no-real-cvr-anchor`

**Summary** (3 bullets — fill before promoting):
- What: measurement-verification.user.md has not been refreshed since 2026-02-13; begin_checkout=0 in the locked baseline despite the funnel code being confirmed live in production since 2026-02-22
- Why: The day-14 gate review and forecast recalibration (both due 2026-02-27) cannot be executed without a refreshed locked GA4 window showing non-zero begin_checkout in the report layer; all CVR-dependent guardrails remain operationally blind
- Next: Re-run the GA4 Data API extract (`7daysAgo..today`), confirm begin_checkout is non-zero in the report window, lock the refreshed baseline in measurement-verification.user.md with the extraction timestamp, then proceed with the day-14 gate review

---

### Finding 2: Feedback Loop Closure — 13 days without a weekly readout; day-14 gate review due tomorrow with no measurement basis

- Fingerprint: `P08-S10-no-second-weekly-readout`
- Severity: 4
- Support: 5
- Stage(s) affected: S10 (weekly readout)
- Failure indicator: Only one KPCS readout exists (2026-02-13); 13 days have elapsed with no second readout; the five KPCS action items have no documented outcome verification; the day-14 gate review is due 2026-02-27 with no measurement baseline refreshed to support it
- Evidence pointer: `docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/` directory listing — single `*kpcs*.user.md` artifact, dated 2026-02-13; `docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/2026-02-13-startup-loop-90-day-forecast-v1.user.md` §7 targets `2026-02-27-forecast-recalibration.user.md` (due tomorrow)
- Status: REPEAT (severity escalated: was 5 days without readout in W08; now 13 days; day-14 gate review can no longer be deferred — it is due tomorrow)

**Why this matters**: The week-1 KPCS explicitly set five follow-up actions with named pass criteria. As of today (13 days later), there is no record of which completed, which stalled, and whether baselines changed. More critically: the forecast recalibration artifact is targeted for tomorrow (2026-02-27) — this requires a day-14 observed KPI pack, which requires at least one refreshed GA4 extract and weekly measurement cadence. Without a week-2 readout, the day-14 gate review cannot be conducted, the recalibration artifact has no evidential basis, and the entire 90-day run contract guardrail system becomes a hypothesis that has never been validated against measured data. Each additional missed readout compounds this blind spot — data from this window is not recoverable retroactively.

Fingerprint: `P08-S10-no-second-weekly-readout`

**Summary** (3 bullets — fill before promoting):
- What: No second weekly KPCS readout has been produced; 13 days have elapsed since week 1 and the day-14 gate review is due tomorrow
- Why: The day-14 gate review and forecast recalibration (2026-02-27) require a weekly measurement cadence that has not been established; week-1 action items (GA4 baseline refresh, policy/fee clarity, cancellation coding) have no outcome record
- Next: Produce the week-2 KPCS now using the weekly-kpcs-decision-prompt.md template; document the status of each week-1 action item; refresh the GA4 7-day extract; conduct the day-14 gate review against the forecast thresholds before the recalibration window closes

## Skipped Findings

| Fingerprint | Severity | Support | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| `P02-S3-no-per-dimension-confidence-scores` | 4 | 3 | prior-signal-review-no-new-evidence (appeared in W08 Skipped Findings as cap-exceeded; situation unchanged; no new evidence since W08) |

## Unresolved Prior Findings

Self-audit is off for this run (runs 1–3). Prior finding tracking begins from run 4.

Note: W08 Finding 1 (`P09-S2-missing-demand-evidence-pack`) is RESOLVED — demand-evidence-pack.md now exists at the canonical gate-check path. W08 Findings 2 (`P04-S2A-conversion-signal-zero-no-real-cvr-anchor`) and 3 (`P08-S10-no-second-weekly-readout`) are re-emitted above with new evidence.

## How to Promote a Finding Brief

To act on a finding:

1. Copy the **Promotion stub** from the Finding Brief you want to promote.
2. Create a new file at `docs/plans/<finding-slug>/fact-find.md`.
3. Paste the frontmatter stub. Fill remaining required fields from `docs/plans/_templates/fact-find-planning.md`.
4. Add `Fingerprint: <fingerprint>` in the body (not in frontmatter).
5. Run `/lp-do-fact-find` on the brief to complete the evidence audit and gap review.
6. Once promoted, future Signal Reviews will suppress this fingerprint (dedup source: open plan tasks).

Suggested invocations after creating files:

    /lp-do-fact-find docs/plans/signal-finding-P04-20260226/fact-find.md
    /lp-do-fact-find docs/plans/signal-finding-P08-20260226/fact-find.md

To act on a Process-Improvement Stub:

1. Review the Suggested fix field — it names the process artifact and the minimum change.
2. Run `/meta-reflect <process-artifact-path>` to open the improvement workflow for that artifact.

## Process-Improvement Stubs

### PI Stub 1: Ground Truth Anchoring — cadence-failure

- Finding-fingerprint: `P04-S2A-conversion-signal-zero-no-real-cvr-anchor` (see Finding 1 above)
- Root-cause class: `cadence-failure`
- Why: The weekly KPCS action item to refresh the GA4 baseline has no enforcement gate in the loop — the measurement-verification.user.md can remain stale indefinitely without any advance block, meaning the day-14 gate review can be approached without a current measurement anchor
- Suggested fix:
  - `.claude/skills/startup-loop/modules/cmd-advance.md` — add a GATE-S2A-REFRESH-01 check before any day-N gate review: require that measurement-verification.user.md date is within the prior 7-day window; if stale, surface a blocking reminder rather than silently proceeding
- Promotion: `/meta-reflect .claude/skills/startup-loop/modules/cmd-advance.md`

---

### PI Stub 2: Feedback Loop Closure — cadence-failure

- Finding-fingerprint: `P08-S10-no-second-weekly-readout` (see Finding 2 above)
- Root-cause class: `cadence-failure`
- Why: The S10 weekly readout is produced once at loop entry but there is no recurring dispatch trigger — the startup loop has no mechanism to detect or surface a stale readout before S10-gated actions proceed
- Suggested fix:
  - `.claude/skills/startup-loop/SKILL.md` — add to S10 dispatch section: if the most recent `*kpcs*.user.md` artifact under `run_root` is >7 days old, surface a blocking reminder before any S10-dependent gate action can proceed; the reminder should link to the KPCS template path
- Promotion: `/meta-reflect .claude/skills/startup-loop/SKILL.md`
