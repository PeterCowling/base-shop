# Plan: Theme Generation Workflow

**Source:** Migrated from `theme-generation-workflow-plan.md`


# Plan: Theme Generation Workflow

Source: `docs/repo-quality-audit-2026-01.md` (Recommendation `P1.3`).

## Summary

Create a standardized workflow for generating new theme packages from a brand brief, enabling operators to create production-ready custom themes within the 3-hour shop launch target.

## Problem Statement

Currently, the platform has strong support for existing themes (multi-theme support, token overrides, CMS theme editor), but creating a net-new brand theme relies on manual token work:

- No standardized generator for creating a new theme package from a brief
- No automated theme validation for contrast/accessibility or visual regression per theme
- Theme selection is fast, but creating a net-new brand theme can consume most of the 3-hour launch window

From the repo quality audit: "Existing themes can ship quickly; net-new themes can consume most of the 3-hour window."

## Goals (Outcomes)
