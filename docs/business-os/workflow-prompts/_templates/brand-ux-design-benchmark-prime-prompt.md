Objective:
Establish the mobile UX and visual design quality bar for Prime, benchmarked against
best-in-class apps serving the same demographic (99% female, 18-25, mobile-only, travel/lifestyle).

Benchmark apps to analyze (≥4 required):
- Airbnb (iOS/Android): onboarding, discovery, booking confirmation UX
- Pinterest: card layouts, color warmth, font choices, scroll interactions
- Hostelworld: guest-facing hospitality on mobile (peer competitor)
- Instagram: navigation patterns, thumb-zone conventions, image presentation
- Glossier mobile site: color warmth, CTA style, typography (optional 5th)

Document for each benchmark:
- Dominant palette mood (warm/cool, saturated/muted)
- Typography classification (geometric sans, humanist, slab, etc.)
- Primary interaction pattern (tab bar, bottom sheet, card stack, etc.)
- Radius/shadow style (sharp/medium/generous)
- Animation style (snappy/fluid/minimal)
- Evidence of demographic fit (app store reviews or research citations if available)

Output format:
1. Benchmark comparison table (app × design attribute)
2. "Minimum quality bar" — what Prime must match to feel native-quality on mobile
3. "Aspirational bar" — what Prime could achieve to feel premium
4. Token implications — for each benchmark finding, which Prime token it informs
   (reference tokens.ts token names, not values)
5. Patterns to avoid — ≥3 design choices from benchmarks that would feel off-brand for Prime

Stop conditions:
- ≥4 benchmark apps documented with all 6 attributes
- Minimum quality bar defined with specific token name recommendations
- ≥3 "patterns to avoid" with rationale
