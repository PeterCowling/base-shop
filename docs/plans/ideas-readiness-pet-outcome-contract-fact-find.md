# Ideas Readiness — PET Outcome Contract Fact-Find

## Scope
Define and freeze the PET business outcome contract so ideation and weekly operations can rank actions by measurable commercial value.

## Evidence Audit (Current State)

- PET outcome contract is now explicitly locked in the canonical strategy file.
  - `docs/business-os/strategy/PET/plan.user.md`
- Forecast and intake artifacts align to the same 90-day target window and contribution/CAC guardrails.
  - `docs/business-os/strategy/PET/italy-90-day-launch-forecast-v2.user.md`
  - `docs/business-os/startup-baselines/PET-forecast-seed.user.md`
- PET website-reference quality has been upgraded from source-family placeholders to URL-level references.
  - `docs/business-os/market-research/PET/2026-02-12-market-intelligence.user.md`

## Locked Contract Snapshot (PET)

| Field | Locked value |
|---|---|
| Outcome-ID | `PET-OUT-2026Q1-01` |
| Outcome | Achieve first reliable PET sales in Italy via pre-website execution, then stabilize contribution-positive growth |
| Baseline | 2026-02-12: orders 0, gross revenue EUR 0, CAC/returns unmeasured |
| Target | 178 orders and EUR 5,874 gross revenue incl VAT |
| By | 2026-05-13 |
| Owner | Pete |
| Weekly leading indicators | Sessions, CVR, blended CAC, CAC/contribution ratio, payment success, on-time ship, return rate |
| Decision-Link | `DEC-PET-01` |
| Margin threshold | Blended CAC must remain <=70% of observed contribution/order pre-ads |

## Remaining Weak Gaps (Post-Lock)

| Gap | Why it still matters | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Exact sellable units + in-stock date confirmation | Needed to validate inventory-constrained forecast realism | Pete |
| Final single/bundle pricing architecture | Needed to validate CAC and contribution ceilings | Pete |
| Payment + shipping day-1 reliability evidence | Needed before traffic scale decisions | Pete |
| TAM denominator URL-level citation refresh | Needed to upgrade top-of-funnel sizing confidence | Pete |
