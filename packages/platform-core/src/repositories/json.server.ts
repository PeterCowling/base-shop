/**
 * Filesystem-backed JSON repositories — single barrel export.
 *
 * • readShop         – fetch shop metadata + theme tokens + nav
 * • readSettings     – fetch settings.json (alias of getShopSettings)
 * • getShopSettings  – underlying helper for settings.json
 * • saveShopSettings – write settings.json atomically
 * • diffHistory      – return patch history for settings.json
 * • products.server  – catalogue helpers (read/write/update/delete/…)
 *
 * The `readShop` helper pulls in a large dependency tree (including the
 * Prisma client) so we lazily import it.  This keeps simple JSON repo
 * consumers – such as unit tests that only touch product helpers – fast and
 * self-contained.
