# Results Review

> Agent-drafted (codemoot fallback — workflow file not found). Operator review recommended before treating as authoritative.

## Observed Outcomes

- `/lp-do-worldclass` skill is now invocable. Invoking it for any business with a goal artifact and aligned benchmark will scan strategy artifacts against world-class standards and emit gap dispatches into the idea pipeline.
- The goal artifact template (`worldclass-goal.template.md`) provides a complete operator-editable YAML artifact with a BRIK worked example, enabling first-use without needing to understand the underlying schema.
- The deep-research prompt generated by goal-phase replaces the need for the operator to structure benchmark research manually — the prompt is domain-specific and produces a structured `worldclass-benchmark.v1` artifact ready for the skill to consume.
- Gap classification is deterministic (4-class rubric with domain-specific anchors) — scan results are reproducible across runs on the same benchmark and data sources.
- All dispatch packets use deterministic key formulas — re-running ideas-phase on the same scan output produces identical `root_event_id`, `anchor_key`, and `cluster_key` values, making deduplication in the queue layer reliable.

## Standing Updates

- `docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/worldclass-goal.md`: Create from template at `docs/plans/lp-do-worldclass/worldclass-goal.template.md` — this is the required first step before `/lp-do-worldclass --biz BRIK` can proceed beyond State 1.
- `.claude/skills/lp-do-worldclass/SKILL.md`: Already registered as a new skill in the skills directory. No further standing update needed — the skill is self-describing.

## New Idea Candidates

- Per-business goal artifact initialization for BRIK | Trigger observation: Template exists but no `docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/worldclass-goal.md` yet — first invocation will halt at State 1 | Suggested next action: create card to initialize BRIK goal artifact and run first scan
- Per-business goal artifact initialization for PWRB | Trigger observation: PWRB strategy directory exists; same blocker applies | Suggested next action: defer until BRIK scan validates the skill end-to-end
- AI-to-mechanistic: deterministic key formula computation (sha256) | Trigger observation: ideas-phase uses fallback "prefix anchor_key-fp padded to 64 chars with 0" when SHA-256 is not feasible in agent runtime — a small utility script or prompt helper could make this deterministic and consistent | Suggested next action: defer until first live scan surfaces an actual inconsistency

## Standing Expansion

No standing expansion: `lp-do-worldclass` is a new skill artifact with no existing standing artifact to expand. The skill itself is the standing artifact. Register `worldclass-goal.md` per business as those are created.

## Intended Outcome Check

- **Intended:** `/lp-do-worldclass --biz <BIZ>` can be invoked for any business with a goal artifact and benchmark, producing dispatch packets for all identified world-class gaps and routing them into `lp-do-ideas`.
- **Observed:** The skill infrastructure is fully built (SKILL.md + 3 modules). No live invocation has been run yet — no goal artifact exists for BRIK at `docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/worldclass-goal.md`, so the skill cannot proceed past State 1. The outcome will be measurable once the BRIK goal artifact is created and a benchmark is pasted in.
- **Verdict:** Partially Met
- **Notes:** Skill is complete and structurally correct per CHECKPOINT-A. Outcome requires a follow-on action (BRIK goal artifact creation + benchmark research) before the full end-to-end path is exercised. This is expected — the skill is infrastructure, not a one-shot deliverable.
