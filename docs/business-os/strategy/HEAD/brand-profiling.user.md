# Brand Strategy — HEAD (ASSESSMENT-10)

## A) Name Confirmation

| Field | Value | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Operating name | Solena | confirmed |
| Name source | shortlist-recommended (round-2 domain-gated screen, 2026-02-21) | — |
| Shortlist considered | Tramilo, Nuvafilo, Calafilo, Filocalma, Tessilo, Aluvia, Solena, Salvara | — |
| Domain status | solena.com — confirmed freely registerable (no DNS, no NS, no SOA — checked 2026-02-21) | — |
| Notes | Solena ranked 3rd in round-2 strategic ranking. Selected for warmth, Italian accessibility, and parent-facing approachability. Previous round-1 recommendation (Nidilo) was eliminated on domain availability. TM pre-clearance (EUIPO Classes 25 and 10) remains a required next step before formal brand commitment. | — |

## B) Audience

**Primary:** Parents and caregivers of children with cochlear implants, primarily in Italy. Children's age range approximately 12 months to 12 years — the period of highest processor-slip frequency and daily handover friction. Problem presents daily: morning setup, school handover, sport, bedtime, travel. Mindset at brand encounter: practical, problem-aware, emotionally invested in their child's daily experience. Not looking for inspiration — looking for a reliable answer to a recurring frustration.

**Secondary:** Active teen and adult CI wearers (approximately 16–45 years). Primary pain: processor slippage during movement. Secondary pain: accessory organisation in transit. Purchase decision is more self-led and style-aware than the caregiver segment.

**Tertiary (awareness, not primary ICP until first-party evidence):** Gift purchasers (family, audiologists recommending accessories). Not a direct-response target at launch.

**Device:** Mobile-first. Italian e-commerce norms and peer-community referral context (CI parenting forums, Facebook groups) favour mobile. Desktop research phase likely for higher-consideration purchases.

**Context:** Discovery primarily via high-intent search ("retention headband cochlear implant", "fascia testa impianto cocleare") and peer referral in CI community forums and parenting groups. At point of discovery, buyer is already problem-aware — they know what they need, they are evaluating fit, compatibility, and trust. Purchase blockers: "Will this fit my child's processor?", "Will it stay on?", "Can I trust this brand?" — not "Do I need this?"

## C) Personality

- **Reassuring**, not clinical — the brand feels safe and steady, never medicalized or alarm-coded
- **Practical**, not purely aspirational — the brand solves a real daily problem first; inspiration is a by-product, not the lead
- **Approachable**, not technical — the brand acknowledges the device without jargon; it speaks plainly to busy parents
- **Inclusive**, not niche-stigmatizing — the brand normalises wearing a headband alongside a CI processor; it never frames the product as a fix for something shameful
- **Warm**, not corporate — the brand sounds like a person, not a manufacturer

## D) Voice & Tone

### Writing Style

- **Formality:** conversational — professional enough for trust, approachable enough for a parent in a Facebook group at 7am
- **Sentence length:** short — answer the practical question fast; secondary information follows
- **Humour:** none — context is a child's medical device; warmth yes, humour no
- **Technical level:** plain language; name processor brands plainly (Cochlear Nucleus, MED-EL Sonnet, Advanced Bionics) when stating compatibility — customers know their own device and want to be met where they are; no clinical or engineering terminology

### Italian copy note

Italian primary market. Italian copy must feel native, not translated. Italian warmth is more direct and less effusive than English warmth — shorter sentences, direct address ("per tuo figlio", "il tuo processore"), less hedging.

### Key Phrases

- **"Fits your processor"** — compatibility-first framing; this is the primary purchase-decision signal; use it early, specifically, with named processor families where possible
- **"Made for everyday wear"** — normalises the use case; positions the headband as a standard part of the daily routine, not a workaround
- **"Secure wear for busy days"** — core campaign-level message; pairs the functional benefit with the real-life context (school, play, travel)
- **"Worn proudly"** — style and inclusion cue; counteracts concealment framing without over-stating it
- **"Your fit, your style"** — used in personalisation and accessory-range contexts; signals range and ownership

### Words to Avoid

- **"improve hearing" / "therapy" / "treatment" / "rehabilitation"** — EU MDR regulatory boundary; these terms risk framing the product as a medical-purpose claim or device-enabling accessory
- **"essential for implant function" / "enables your processor to work"** — MDR accessory-enabling language; hard stop
- **"hide" / "invisible" / "discreet" / "conceal"** as a primary promise — conflicts with inclusive positioning; the brand normalises wearing, not concealment
- **"fits all processors"** without a verified compatibility matrix — overpromising; generates returns and erodes trust
- Medical jargon (e.g., "implant-compatible device interface", "retention coefficient") — alienating; not how parents talk
- Stigmatising framing ("despite having a hearing loss", "even though your child wears a device") — the brand treats CI wear as ordinary, not as something to overcome
