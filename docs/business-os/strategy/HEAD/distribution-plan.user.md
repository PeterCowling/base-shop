# Distribution Plan — HEAD (ASSESSMENT-06)

## A) Channel List

| Channel | Type | Cost/Effort | ICP Fit Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Own-site DTC (search + retargeting) | DTC / paid | Medium — EUR 900/mo capped | High-intent caregivers searching CI accessories; best surface for bundle merchandising (pouch, patches) and CAC/CVR control |
| Community referrals (caregiver groups, associations) | Organic / social | Low — EUR 250/mo, script-led outreach | Primary ICP trusts peer referrals over cold ads; CI caregiver Facebook groups (18k+ members) are the lowest-CAC acquisition surface |
| Etsy probe lane | Marketplace | Low — EUR 250/mo, constrained SKUs + fixed probe window | Validates pricing vs existing third-party CI market (Geniebands et al.); fast experiment loop on product naming and merchandising |

## B) Fatal Blocker Check

| Channel | Blocker | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Own-site DTC | None | Clear |
| Community referrals | None | Clear |
| Etsy probe | None | Clear |

## C) Launch Priority

| Priority | Channel | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Primary | Own-site DTC | Full funnel control, CAC instrumentation, bundle optimisation — aligns with DEC-HEAD-CH-01 |
| Secondary | Community referrals | Lowest CAC, highest trust fit for ICP-A (caregivers) |
| Tertiary (probe) | Etsy | Demand sampling and pricing validation; not a primary conversion surface |
