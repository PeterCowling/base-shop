    "Arriving by car Positano is possible, but it is rarely the easiest option. Roads are narrow, enforcement is strict, and parking is scarce and expensive.",
    "If you drive, plan to park the car once and leave it stored for your stay. If you want less stress (and often a lower total cost), park outside Positano and finish by bus or ferry."
