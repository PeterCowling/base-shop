# Base-Shop Security Audit Plan

## TODO
- [ ] Confirm data owners for each slice before starting manual review interviews.
- [ ] Capture evidence of all auth flows (session + NextAuth) in threat model notes.
- [ ] Schedule deep dives with infra team on Cloudflare deployment and cron triggers.
- [ ] Align audit timelines with availability of Cypress E2E maintainers for reproduction help.
- [ ] Track remediation tickets per slice in the security backlog once findings emerge.

## 1. High-level system map
### Languages & frameworks
- **TypeScript / React 19 / Next.js 15** for CMS and shop applications, deployed via Cloudflare Pages adapter (`README.md`, `next.config.mjs`).
- **Cloudflare Workers** runtime for the API worker routes (`wrangler.toml`, `apps/api/src/routes/**`).
- **Node.js scripts** and CLI tooling orchestrated through pnpm workspaces (`package.json` scripts section).
- **Prisma + PostgreSQL** data models defined in `packages/platform-core/prisma/schema.prisma`.

### Entry points & workloads
- **CMS Next.js app** exposes API routes for deploy, media upload, CSV import, and SEO tools (`apps/cms/src/app/api/**`).
- **Shop BCD Next.js app** handles customer-facing auth, account, checkout, tax/shipping, and preview APIs (`apps/shop-bcd/src/app/api/**`).
- **Cloudflare worker API** provides upgrade-preview and publish endpoints for shops (`apps/api/src/routes/components/[shopId].ts`, `apps/api/src/routes/shop/[id]/publish-upgrade.ts`).
- **Scheduled workers / cron jobs** for SEO audits and editorial publishing (`functions/src/seoAudit.ts`, `functions/src/publishEditorial.ts`, `wrangler.toml` cron trigger).
- **Background services** like deposit release, reverse logistics, and stock alerts in `packages/platform-machine/src/**` and `packages/platform-core/src/services/**`.
- **CLI tooling** for shop initialization, inventory import/export, deposit release, etc. under `scripts/src/*.ts` and pnpm commands in `package.json`.

### Authentication & authorization
- **NextAuth credentials flow** for CMS admins with argon2 password verification and role-based session claims (`apps/cms/src/auth/options.ts`).
- **Customer session + MFA service** built on iron-session cookies with optional Redis backing (`packages/auth/src/session.ts`, `packages/auth/src/store.ts`, `packages/auth/src/mfa.ts`).
- **RBAC helpers** and permission maps consumed by both CMS and platform services (`packages/auth/src/rbac.ts`, `packages/auth/src/permissions.ts`).

### Storage & state
- **Prisma/PostgreSQL** for core entities (shops, pages, orders, users, MFA secrets) with optional JSON fallbacks controlled by `*_BACKEND` env vars (`packages/platform-core/prisma/schema.prisma`, `docs/persistence.md`, `packages/platform-core/src/repositories/**`).
- **Filesystem data root** for offline/demo storage resolved via `resolveDataRoot` (`packages/platform-core/src/dataRoot.ts`, `data/shops/**`).
- **Cloudflare KV** for cart state (`wrangler.toml`) and optional Redis for customer sessions (`packages/auth/src/store.ts`).

### Outbound integrations & third parties
- **Stripe** server SDK / fetch client with optional mock mode (`packages/stripe/src/index.ts`, `packages/platform-core/src/handleStripeWebhook.ts`, `packages/platform-machine/src/releaseDepositsService.ts`).
- **Email providers** (SendGrid, Resend) for campaigns and alerts (`packages/email/src/providers/sendgrid.ts`, `packages/email/src/providers/resend.ts`, `packages/platform-core/src/services/stockAlert.server.ts`).
- **Sanity headless CMS** for editorial content (`packages/sanity/src/index.ts`, `functions/src/publishEditorial.ts`).
- **Analytics / SEO tooling** via in-house modules and outbound webhook targets (`functions/src/seoAudit.ts`, `packages/platform-core/src/analytics/index.ts`).

### Configuration & secret sources
- **Central env schema** enforcing required secrets and feature flags (`packages/config/src/env/core.ts`).
- **Environment reference** documenting all expected variables and fallbacks (`docs/.env.reference.md`).
- **Shop-level config files** persisted under `data/shops/<id>/*.json` and mutated by admin workflows (`apps/cms/src/actions/deployShop.server.ts`).

### Testing & coverage hot spots
- **Extensive Jest suites** for repositories, services, and worker routes (`apps/api/src/routes/**/__tests__`, `packages/platform-core/src/**/__tests__`, `packages/auth/src/__tests__`).
- **Cypress E2E coverage** for CMS, dashboard, and shop flows (`apps/cms/cypress/e2e/*.cy.ts`).
- **Unit tests for Next APIs** across shop and CMS apps (`apps/shop-bcd/src/app/api/**/route.test.ts`, `apps/cms/src/app/api/**/__tests__`).
- **Docs** describing test modes and Prisma stubs vs. live DB (`__tests__/docs/testing.md`).

## 2. Externally reachable surfaces & trust boundaries
- **Public shopper surface:** `/apps/shop-bcd` routes, static pages, and API endpoints rely on signed customer sessions; they interact with Prisma and JSON stores through `@platform-core` repositories (`apps/shop-bcd/src/app/api/login/route.ts`, `packages/platform-core/src/orders/creation.ts`). Trust boundary between anonymous users, authenticated customers, and backend services.
- **CMS admin surface:** Protected Next.js routes under `/apps/cms` for media upload, CSV imports, deploy actions, and provider management. Relies on NextAuth and RBAC, writes to `data/shops/<id>` and triggers build/deploy commands (`apps/cms/src/app/api/upload-csv/[shop]/route.ts`, `apps/cms/src/actions/deployShop.server.ts`). Trust boundary between authenticated admins and filesystem/CLI execution environment.
- **Upgrade worker API:** Cloudflare Worker endpoints for component diffs and publishing upgrades require bearer tokens but run privileged commands (`apps/api/src/routes/components/[shopId].ts`, `apps/api/src/routes/shop/[id]/publish-upgrade.ts`). Boundary between remote callers with token access and repository filesystem/child process execution.
- **Scheduled jobs:** Cron-triggered SEO audits and editorial publishing iterate over all shops, send email, and append to JSONL logs (`functions/src/seoAudit.ts`, `functions/src/publishEditorial.ts`). Trust boundary between Cloudflare scheduler and outbound providers/analytics store.
- **Stripe & email webhooks/outbound:** Stripe webhook handlers and refund automation depend on secrets and call out to Stripe APIs, while stock alerts hit arbitrary webhooks (`packages/platform-core/src/handleStripeWebhook.ts`, `packages/platform-machine/src/releaseDepositsService.ts`, `packages/platform-core/src/services/stockAlert.server.ts`).
- **CLI / operator boundary:** Scripts under `scripts/src` perform network requests to CMS APIs, mutate filesystem data, and run shell commands (`scripts/src/inventory.ts`, `scripts/src/init-shop.ts`). Operators executing them must supply trusted environment variables/secrets.
