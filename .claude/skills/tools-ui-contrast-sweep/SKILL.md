# Contrast + Uniformity Sweep

Audit rendered UI across explicit breakpoints and theme modes to find legibility and visual-system consistency failures.

This skill is diagnostic only: identify, evidence, classify, and propose fix direction. Do not redesign or patch code during the sweep unless explicitly requested.

## Relationship to Other Skills

- `tools-web-breakpoint`: responsive containment/reflow failures across breakpoints. Use together when contrast failures appear only after responsive stacking.
- `lp-design-qa`: static code/token/a11y audit without runtime screenshots. Use to trace root causes for repeated uniformity drift.
- `meta-user-test`: broad site-wide health audit. Use when route coverage should be sitemap-driven rather than operator-selected.
- `lp-do-build`: implement fixes after this report is approved.

## Required First Prompt

If missing from operator input, ask exactly:

`Which breakpoint widths (px) and which theme modes (light/dark/brand themes) should I test for contrast + uniformity?`

Then collect required surfaces:

`Which UI surfaces should be in scope (header/nav, primary CTAs, forms, modals, tables, marketing pages)?`

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Breakpoints (px) | Yes | e.g. `320, 375, 430, 768, 1024, 1280` |
| Theme modes | Yes | light/dark/brand themes |
| Target surfaces | Yes | scope-critical areas to audit |
| Standard | No (recommended) | default `WCAG 2.x AA`; operator may request AAA |
| Token references | No | `tokens.ts`, CSS vars, Tailwind/token docs |

If operator gives only breakpoints:
- default to `WCAG 2.x AA`
- run light mode first
- record assumptions explicitly in the report

## Standards and Thresholds

Use these defaults unless operator requests otherwise.

### WCAG AA defaults

- Normal text (`<18pt` and `<14pt bold`): `>= 4.5:1`
- Large text (`>=18pt` or `>=14pt bold`): `>= 3.0:1`
- Non-text essential UI (icons, borders, controls): `>= 3.0:1`
- Focus indicators: `>= 3.0:1` against adjacent colors and visibly discernible

### If operator requests AAA

- Normal text: `>= 7.0:1`
- Large text: `>= 4.5:1`
- Non-text/focus checks remain at WCAG non-text contrast criteria (`>= 3.0:1`)

### Sampling requirement for complex backgrounds

For gradients/images/translucent overlays/blurred surfaces, sample multiple points and report:
- worst-case ratio (required)
- average ratio (recommended)

## Repo Context to Load

Before auditing, load the visual-system baseline:

- `docs/design-system-handbook.md`
- `docs/typography-and-color.md`
- `packages/themes/<theme>/src/tokens.ts` (or `packages/themes/base/src/tokens.ts`)
- `packages/design-system/src/utils/style/overflowContainment.ts`

For token drift triage, run static scans in affected app paths (examples):

- non-token colors: `rg -n "#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,8}|rgb\\(|hsl\\(" apps packages`
- default Tailwind palette drift: `rg -n "\\b(bg|text|border)-(red|orange|amber|yellow|lime|green|emerald|teal|cyan|sky|blue|indigo|violet|purple|fuchsia|pink|rose)-(50|100|200|300|400|500|600|700|800|900)\\b" apps packages`
- arbitrary sizing/spacing drift (triage only): `rg -n "\\[[0-9.]+(px|rem|em|vh|vw|%)\\]" apps packages`

## Workflow

### 1) Intake and Matrix Setup

1. Confirm breakpoints, modes, surfaces, and standard (AA/AAA).
2. Resolve route list from operator surfaces (or infer best-effort routes and mark assumptions).
3. Set stable viewport height (default `900`).
4. Prepare artifact folder and screenshot naming convention.

### 2) Breakpoint Sweep Execution

For each breakpoint `W` and each mode:
1. Set viewport to `W x 900`.
2. Visit each target route/surface.
3. Capture baseline screenshot.
4. Run contrast checks and uniformity checks.
5. Trigger interaction states where feasible:
   - hover / active
   - disabled
   - `focus-visible` via keyboard tab flow
   - modal/drawer/popover open states
   - form error states (if low-friction to trigger)

### 3) Contrast Checks (priority order)

Audit:
- primary text blocks (body/headings/captions/helper text)
- interactive text (links, button labels, nav items)
- form affordances (placeholder, borders, error/success text)
- icons and badges (especially icon-only controls)
- focus rings/outlines during keyboard navigation
- overlay scenarios (scrims, translucency, image cards, gradients)

Flag contrast findings when:
- measured ratio is below threshold
- normal state is borderline and fails on hover/focus/disabled/error
- worst-case sample on gradient/image fails
- placeholder substitutes label with low contrast
- focus indicator exists but is visually indistinct

Evidence required per contrast finding:
- breakpoint + mode + route
- element label/selector/component best-effort
- state (`default|hover|focus|disabled|error|active`)
- measured ratio(s) with threshold (worst-case mandatory)
- screenshot with element clearly visible

### 4) Uniformity Checks (priority order)

Audit:
- color/token compliance and repeated non-token drift
- component consistency (buttons/links/inputs across routes)
- typography consistency (size/weight/line-height hierarchy)
- spacing/radius/shadow rhythm consistency
- dark-mode parity for hierarchy/affordances

Flag uniformity findings when:
- same component family differs materially in computed styles
- repeated non-token colors or inconsistent opacity values appear
- disabled/focus states differ across equivalent components
- same semantic meaning uses conflicting visual treatments
- hierarchy weakens (e.g., heading visually weaker than body)

Evidence required per uniformity finding:
- breakpoint + mode + route
- component family (best effort)
- exact observed difference (what differs and where)
- screenshot pair (`reference` vs `drift`)
- likely cause hypothesis (token bypass/local override/missing variant)

### 5) Severity Model

- **S1 Blocker**: text/controls not reliably readable; critical actions obscured; focus effectively invisible for keyboard users
- **S2 Major**: widespread AA/AAA failures on key UI or system inconsistency harming trust/comprehension
- **S3 Minor**: localized drift/cosmetic inconsistency without material task failure

### 6) Responsive-vs-Palette Attribution Rule

If a contrast failure appears only at specific breakpoints due to layout/image stacking, classify as responsive root cause (with contrast impact), not pure palette failure. Cross-reference `tools-web-breakpoint` for follow-up.

### 7) Output Artifacts

Write report + screenshots:

- Report: `docs/audits/contrast-sweeps/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/contrast-uniformity-report.md`
- Screenshots: `docs/audits/contrast-sweeps/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/screenshots/`

Optional machine-readable artifacts (recommended for regression tracking):

- `docs/audits/contrast-sweeps/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/contrast-findings.json`
- `docs/audits/contrast-sweeps/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/uniformity-findings.json`

Use `.claude/skills/tools-ui-contrast-sweep/modules/report-template.md` for required structure.

### 8) Completion Message

Return:
- breakpoints and modes tested
- surfaces/routes covered
- issue totals by severity
- report path + JSON artifact paths (if produced)
- assumptions and uncovered scope gaps

If no issues are found, state exactly:

`No contrast or visual-uniformity failures detected across the tested breakpoint/mode matrix.`

## Guardrails

- Do not propose color changes that break brand intent without noting tradeoffs.
- Prefer token-level/component-variant fixes over per-page overrides.
- Validate `focus-visible` states explicitly via keyboard path.
- Avoid reporting micro-differences unless they affect readability, interaction, or hierarchy.
