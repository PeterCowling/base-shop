# MARKET-02 Demand Evidence for Caryina's Etsy Demand Test

## Demand snapshot

Across Q4 2025 to Q1 2026, bag charms look less like a short-lived micro-trend and more like a durable "bag customisation" behaviour that is still culturally active but maturing. Fashion coverage in early 2026 increasingly frames the category as "still happening, but evolving" away from noisy novelty/character overload and toward more refined, texture-led and "craft authenticity" executions.

The most important nuance for Caryina's demand test is that this does not automatically validate the specific hypothesis ("latent demand at €80–€150 for a premium, artisan, mini-handbag silhouette charm with an Italian origin story"). The strongest available signals for Q1 2026 do, however, support three operational beliefs:

1. Consumers still want "something on my bag," but the category is entering a phase where differentiation comes from taste + quality cues + authenticity, not pure novelty.
2. Discovery and conversion are happening on Etsy, evidenced by real-time "in carts / low stock / favourites" signals in adjacent product types (mini pouches, "mini bag charm" items).
3. The AirPods case subcategory is high-demand but commoditised on Etsy, meaning an €80–€100 H2 needs a stronger "fashion object" framing than the typical personalised tech cover.

## Section 1 — Demand Indicators

### Search signals

**Google Trends trajectory**

A direct, query-by-query extraction from Google Trends (including peak index vs current index for "bag charm", "mini bag charm", "handbag charm", "Birkin bag charm") could not be reliably reproduced in the research environment for Q1 2026. This means any claim about exact index values must be treated as a Gap unless it comes from a credible secondary source that explicitly reports those values.

The best accessible Google Trends-adjacent signal that is both specific and sourceable is a mid-2025 reference: an industry blog citing Google Trends states that searches for "bag charms" hit another peak in July 2025. Confidence: Medium (credible source, but not a primary export).

A practical inference for Q1 2026 (noting the limitations above) is that the category appears to be in an elevated plateau with seasonal spikes rather than a collapse: major 2026 editorial outlets are still publishing bag-charm trend pieces in February 2026, but describing it as a shift in expression rather than "new". Confidence: Medium (inference from editorial persistence and framing).

**Etsy search autocomplete**

A clean, reproducible capture of Etsy's actual autocomplete dropdown (top 5–8 suggestions for "bag charm", "leather bag charm", "mini bag") was not verifiably accessible in a way that allows evidence logging (Etsy's suggestions are dynamically generated and not consistently exposed in crawlable HTML).

The closest channel-native proxy that is observable is Etsy's maintained "market" taxonomy pages — which usually exist only when a term has durable search/use volume. These pages support that buyer intent vocabulary on Etsy includes (at minimum): "bag charm" and "mini charm bag". Confidence: Medium (taxonomy is not autocomplete, but it is an Etsy-side intent artefact).

A second proxy is high-performing listing titling that repeatedly encodes buyer vocabulary ("mini leather bag charm", "keychain coin purse", "AirPods case keychain"). For example, a leather "mini bag charm" listing written in this vocabulary shows hundreds of favourites and gift-oriented copy. Confidence: High (listing title and engagement are observable).

**Pinterest trajectory**

Direct, official Pinterest Trends time-series for "bag charms" from Q4 2025 → Q1 2026 was not available via accessible primary sources in this run, so any updated % growth claim for that specific timeframe is a Gap.

However, credible fashion media continues to report Pinterest-based growth signals in the broader era (pre-Q4 2025), indicating Pinterest was a strong discovery engine for bag charms in the trend's expansion phase. Confidence: Medium (credible media, but not the requested period).

---

### Social signals

**TikTok scale and virality proxy signals**

Direct hashtag view counts from TikTok pages (e.g., #bagcharm, #bagcharms, #bagjewelry, #minibagcharm) were not retrievable from primary TikTok pages in this environment, so exact "views" per hashtag for Q1 2026 is a Gap.

What is available and highly relevant is a Q4 2025 platform-scale proxy: a fashion-industry tracker article reports that #Labubu content on TikTok was extremely large in 2025 (millions of posts, billions of views) and explicitly positions Labubu as an offshoot of the broader bag-charm trend, noting that the Labubu wave peaked in spring 2025 and cooled later in the year. Confidence: High (named metric in a major fashion-business publication).

A second, earlier but still structurally useful datapoint: a year-in-TikTok fashion tracker noted bag charms as a top "trending product" category and provided an order-of-magnitude post count for #BagCharms. Confidence: Medium (older, but still a strong indicator of format adoption on the platform).

**Instagram signals**

Primary Instagram hashtag volumes are not consistently accessible (often login-gated and subject to UI changes). Therefore, "hashtag volume" claims for Q1 2026 are a Gap in this pass.

What is observable through credible secondary reporting is that Instagram-era "chaotic customisation" and bag-charm styling formats were sufficiently widespread to be described as a large, multi-object customisation behaviour (bags, lip balms, water bottles), reinforcing the "customisable canvas" framing. Confidence: Medium.

**Buyer voice and qualitative pull ("I'm looking for the right one")**

Reddit provides unusually clear buyer voice on two issues that matter specifically for an €80–€150 Etsy test:

- Buyers actively search for charm sources and aesthetics, including "cute" and "kawaii" discovery behaviour, and explicitly describe Etsy as a search destination.
- Buyers warn each other about dropship/reseller noise in "leather-looking" Etsy search results, which can create friction and simultaneously create a premium opening for credible origin + materials proof.

A strong Q1 2026 signal of "collector" behaviour: a high-engagement post shows buyers paying above MSRP via secondary channels for desired premium charm SKUs, implying that at least a subset of buyers treats charms as status/style pieces worth hunting. Confidence: Medium (it's not Etsy demand, but it is premium willingness-to-pay behaviour).

### Marketplace signals on Etsy

**Badge distribution and "bestseller" placement**

A systematic, category-wide count of "bestseller" badges specifically in the €60–€150 band was not feasible in this pass without an Etsy-wide scrape (not done), so a quantified distribution is a Gap.

That said, Etsy's category pages do reveal where the platform has deep inventory and high review density (a common proxy for high demand):

- Leather AirPods case markets have very large SKU depth (hundreds to thousands of items), with multiple listings showing extremely high review counts — pointing to large demand but also intense competition and a low reference price. Confidence: High (counts are visible on Etsy market pages).

**Observable "in carts" / "low in stock" signals**

While a verified €80+ example showing "X sold in the last 24 hours" was not captured, Etsy does surface conversion intent signals in adjacent bag-charm style listings:

- "Rare find, already in 2 carts" appears on a "mini bag charm" accessory listing dated late Nov 2025. Confidence: High (direct listing page observation).
- "Low in stock, only 3 left" appears on a custom mini charm listing (late 2025). Confidence: High (direct listing page observation).
- A leather mini pouch / "mini leather bag charm" listing posted in Dec 2025 shows 359 favourites, indicating wishlist intent and sustained browsing interest. Confidence: High.

These are not perfect stand-ins for a premium handbag-silhouette charm at €95–€120, but they do support the claim that Etsy buyers are actively purchasing and bookmarking "bag add-ons" and mini accessories within the broader charm ecosystem.

## Section 2 — Segment-Level Pull Signals and Urgency Cues

### ICP-A — Bag charm buyer

For the fashion-aware handbag owner segment, the strongest Q1 2026 signal is trend persistence plus aesthetic evolution:

- Early 2026 editorial explicitly says the earlier "cute/quirky" wave became ubiquitous and less special, but that bag charms continue in 2026 via more refined, texture-led and "grown-up" executions. Confidence: High for "evolving, not disappearing" claim.
- The same early 2026 period includes runway-to-retail storytelling around bag charm drops (e.g., Coach's "book" charms being treated as collectible objects, with audience anticipation and DIY copying behaviour described). Confidence: Medium (directionally strong, but brand-specific).

Urgency cues relevant to Caryina's positioning:

- **Status-through-personalisation (entry-point luxury logic):** charms can be "small luxury" while the bag is the big-ticket item. This remains a repeated justification in trend commentary and consumer discussion. Confidence: Medium.
- **Quality and authenticity anxiety on Etsy:** buyer warnings about resellers act as a forcing function — premium buyers want proof (materials, origin, hardware durability). Confidence: High (direct buyer voice).

### ICP-B — Gift buyers

Bag charms remain structurally giftable because they sit in a "sweet spot": personal, visible, and cheaper than a handbag while still feeling meaningful.

- Late 2025 gifting editorial explicitly treats bag charms as holiday-appropriate and enduring. Confidence: Medium (syndicated editorial).
- Etsy sellers themselves write gift-calendar intent into listings (Christmas, Valentine's, Mother's Day, teacher gifts), which is a direct Etsy-native signal that buyers purchase these items as gifts. Confidence: High.

### ICP-C — Amalfi tourist

For the June–September Amalfi tourist segment, the relevant question is not "are there tourists," but "do tourists buy premium artisan accessories as souvenirs?"

Channel-adjacent economic signals suggest the shopping-motivated tourist segment is large and growing:

- A national travel/economics report summarised by a major Italian news agency estimates €20–€22B of shopping tourism spend in Italy in 2024, and 2.4M tourists who visited Italy primarily to shop (+14% vs 2023). Confidence: Medium (reported second-hand via ANSA; underlying sources include Bank of Italy / Mastercard / ISTAT elaborations).
- A payments/tourism report states that fashion and accessories account for ~12.2% of foreign visitors' in-destination spending in Italy (2024), supporting the relevance of accessories as a tourist purchase category. Confidence: Medium.

Local category adjacency (souvenir norms) reinforces plausibility:

- Travel shopping guides consistently present artisanal fashion purchases (e.g., Positano handmade leather sandals) as "canonical" Amalfi Coast buys, reinforcing that tourists already look for artisan-made wearable accessories as souvenirs. Confidence: Medium (travel editorial, not spend data).

## Section 3 — Seasonality and Timing Effects

### Bag charm seasonality

Because primary Google Trends time series could not be extracted here, the annual peak months for "bag charm" searches cannot be quantified with high confidence.

What can be supported from accessible evidence is the presence of two predictable timing engines:

- **Holiday gifting:** bag charms appear in December gift editorial and sellers explicitly frame them for Christmas/Valentine's/Mother's Day, implying seasonal conversion spikes. Confidence: Medium.
- **Runway-to-street diffusion:** early 2026 coverage explicitly links bag charm formats to runway moments and the subsequent spread into everyday styling, suggesting cyclical "new charm look" refreshes aligned with fashion calendar moments. Confidence: Medium.

### H2 seasonality and Apple product cycles

For an AirPods-holder product, Apple release cycles matter because accessory buying often clusters around new device purchases and gifting.

- Apple announced AirPods 4 on 9 September 2024.
- Apple announced AirPods Pro 3 on 9 September 2025, with availability from 19 September 2025.

**Implication for a Q1 2026 Etsy test:** Q4 2025 likely contained a "new AirPods Pro 3 owner" accessory wave, and Q1 2026 demand may represent a tail rather than the peak of that particular cycle. Confidence: Medium (common accessory behaviour; dates are confirmed).

### Amalfi tourist season window

Multiple travel sources align on a summer peak, with June/September strong shoulder months and July–August the most crowded.

- A local-based travel guidance piece notes the main tourist operating season (services open, ferries running) broadly from spring through early autumn, and points to July–September as best for classic beach holiday conditions.
- A destination travel guide notes fewer tourists in June and tapering in September.

---

## Section 4 — Counter-Signals (Weak Demand or Saturation Warnings)

### Bag charm trend maturity and potential backlash

A key Q1 2026 counter-signal is not that bag charms are "over," but that the first wave is described as too ubiquitous — a classic transition from early adoption to mainstream sameness.

- Early 2026 coverage explicitly describes the earlier bag charm look as having "reached its peak" (in its 2024–2025 form) because it became omnipresent and less differentiating, even while the category continues via a new aesthetic direction. Confidence: High.

This matters for Caryina: it increases the value of taste discipline (quiet, craft, natural textures) but also raises the risk of "seen it before" unless the mini-handbag silhouette is genuinely distinctive on Etsy at €95–€120.

### H2 commoditisation warning

Etsy's AirPods leather case environment shows clear signs of deep competition and a lower reference price:

- "Airpods leather case" shows 3,000+ items and features multiple listings with very high review counts in price bands commonly below ~$50. Confidence: High.
- "Leather Air Pod Case" shows 495+ items, similarly dominated by low-to-mid pricing and large review volumes. Confidence: High.

This is a warning, not a demand-killer: it suggests that an €80–€100 AirPods holder needs to behave more like "bag jewellery / fashion accessory" than "tech cover," and must over-invest in photography, hardware finish, and origin proof.

### Etsy organic traffic decline signals

No Etsy seller forum / community evidence was found in this pass indicating a Q4 2025–Q1 2026 decline in organic traffic specifically for bag charm listings. This remains a Gap.

**Open gaps (material):** exact Google Trends index values for the named queries in Q1 2026; Etsy autocomplete suggestion lists; TikTok and Instagram hashtag view/post volumes captured directly from primary platform pages; Etsy-wide "bestseller" badge distribution analysis in the €60–€150 band; Etsy internal "favourites over time" or conversion-rate metrics for handbag-silhouette charms.
