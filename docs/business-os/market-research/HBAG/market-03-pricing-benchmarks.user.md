# MARKET-03 pricing benchmarks for Caryina

Caryina is testing two premium artisan bag accessories on Etsy: an H1 mini-handbag silhouette charm (target €95–€120) and an H2 AirPods holder built from the same "micro bag" body (target €80–€100). The aim of MARKET-03 is to identify revealed pricing behaviour inside the €60–€150 artisan-premium band: where Etsy buyers actually convert (via review density, favourites, "in carts/low stock" signals, discounting), and what price-quality cues sustain conversion above ~$79.

---

## Pricing takeaways for Q1 2026

The main Etsy pricing reality is a volume cliff, not a brick-wall ceiling. At ~$60–$80, multiple adjacent "premium-coded" shops show large-scale proof of conversion (thousands of shop reviews/sales). For example, SexylittleVintage sells a $79 "one of a kind" multi-charm accessory while the shop shows ~3.7k reviews and ~14.4k sales—strong evidence that ~$79 can be a high-velocity price point if the listing signals "designer-bag-adjacent" value.

Above ~$100, conversion can still happen on Etsy, but it more often looks like lower review volume + higher intent signals (large favourite counts, "in cart/low stock," and "this is a tiny art object" framing). A clear example is MattLucasSingapore: a $155 leather lobster bag charm shows 974 favourites and "only 3 left," but only 2 item reviews in the captured snapshot—consistent with a considered purchase rather than a high-frequency impulse buy.

A second example is TyransLeatherShop: a $104.91 leather Taiyaki coin-pouch charm has 22 item reviews and 2,448 favourites, demonstrating that $100+ can convert when an item is distinct, giftable, and photographed as a premium object within a charm ecosystem.

For H1 specifically, Etsy's category expectations remain anchored low: the "mini Birkin/mini handbag charm" silhouette is dominated by sub-$30 listings (often with hundreds of reviews), which means Caryina's €95–€120 must fight a strong price anchor even if the competition does not look premium.

There are outliers: Etsy market pages display at least one "mini bag" charm listing around €125–€126 with ~9–11 reviews shown, suggesting some willingness to pay near €120 for a mini-bag charm look—though the listing details were not reliably retrievable for verification, so it should be treated as a weak but encouraging signal rather than a firm benchmark.

For H2, Etsy shows deep commoditisation: the highest item-review densities in personalised leather AirPods cases cluster around ~$20–$50, often supported by aggressive "original price → sale price" anchoring. A single "engraved Apple airpod case" market page shows a leather case with 13.7k reviews converting at $44.10 sale price (with an $89.99 "original price" shown).

Concrete listing examples reinforce this: Dreamerleathergoods shows 92 item reviews at $25.83+ (49% off), while JoylleDesign shows 79 item reviews at $17.20+ (50% off).

This is the clearest warning for Caryina's H2: €80–€100 only works if the product is framed as a fashion accessory (a micro-bag charm) rather than a tech cover, because Etsy buyers already have abundant "leather + monogram" options far below €80 with substantial conversion history.

## Section 1 — Benchmark price bands across direct and adjacent competitors

The table below consolidates the MARKET-01 competitor set and the most pricing-relevant Etsy outliers discovered in MARKET-03. "Reviews proxy" uses the most visible conversion proxy (item reviews when shown; otherwise shop-level reviews/sales shown on the listing snapshot). Prices are "as displayed" in captured marketplace views and can vary by buyer region/currency and by temporary promotions.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SexylittleVintage | Etsy | H1-adjacent premium charm stack | $79.00 | Shop: ~3.7k reviews; ~14.4k sales | "One of the kind"; low stock; "genuine & vachetta leather"; free shipping shown |
| SPECSET | Etsy + DTC | Bag jewellery premium (pearls/chain) | Etsy snapshot: $82.77 (20% off from $103.46); DTC: €80 | Etsy shop: ~818 reviews; ~3.7k sales | Sale badge; low stock; "gift-ready" framing; personalisation field present on Etsy snapshot; DTC shows stock count |
| TRIMleather | Etsy | H2 leather AirPods case + clasp | $69.90 | Shop: ~2.5k reviews; ~14.5k sales; Item: 3 reviews | Made-to-order; "add initials" custom option; gift wrap add-on; free shipping shown |
| PEGAI | Etsy | H2 premium tier (python variant) | $99.00 | Shop: ~18.8k–19.2k reviews; ~107k–111k sales | Feature-heavy premium framing (suede, magnetic closure, "top 3% hides" claim); US-only shipping on python listing |
| NitmoiStudio | Etsy + DTC | H2 artisan leather + brass clip | $55.29+ | Shop: 71 reviews; 179 sales; Item: none yet | Hot-foil personalisation options; maker-identified copy; brass clip; "full-grain Italian leather" |
| YLSecretHeart | Etsy | H1 artisan leather charms (incl. "Kelly Bag Charms" keywording) | $76.88 | Shop: 655 reviews; 2.3k sales | High favourites; "in cart" signals appear; many designs at same ~$76.88 price point |
| TyransLeatherShop | Etsy | H1 artisan flower/orchid charm | $72.45+ (orchid); $87.61 (colour orchid) | Shop: ~33–39 reviews; ~119–163 sales | Personalisation with explicit add-on pricing (extra petals/orchids); "wearable art" framing; Star Seller |
| TyransLeatherShop | Etsy | Premium "pouch-as-charm" (Taiyaki coin pouch) | $104.91 | Item: 22 reviews | 2,448 favourites; "20+ views last 24 hours"; review issues include "made-to-order took long," "hardware scratched leather" |
| MattLucasSingapore | Etsy | Ultra-premium leather charm object | $155.00 | Item: 2 reviews; Shop: ~412 reviews; ~1.2k sales | 974 favourites; scarcity (only 3 left); reviews call it "work of art" / "unique charm" |
| Dreamerleathergoods | Etsy | H2 commoditised "premium content" (monogram leather case) | $25.83+ (49% off) | Item: 92 reviews | Heavy markdown; personalisation and gift framing; buyer notes include "came a bit late" |
| JoylleDesign | Etsy | H2 commoditised monogram leather case | $17.20+ (50% off) | Item: 79 reviews; item avg 3.4/5 | Strong promotion; personalisation; notable negative reviews ("never arrived," "comes apart") |
| Sticky Zoo | DTC | DTC charm stacks | €59.95–€117.95 | N/A | "Collectible drop" merchandising; some sale pricing; higher material/hardware claims (e.g., 18K gold-plated hardware, French leather) |
| String Ting | DTC | Premium "Bag Ting" charms | £65–£250 | N/A (site shows ratings on products/collection) | Broad price ladder up to £250; frequent sale pricing; free shipping threshold £70; "lifetime restring" positioning |
| MAISON de SABRÉ | DTC | AirPods case benchmark | AUD $22.50 (70% off from AUD $75) | 845 reviews on a SKU | Free personalisation; strong luxury-story framing; deep discounting ("final sale") |

The review-dense portion of Etsy's premium-coded charm ecosystem concentrates around ~$70–$80 for "designer-bag-adjacent" bag accessories (SexylittleVintage at $79; TRIMleather at $69.90; YLSecretHeart designs at $76.88).

A second density cluster exists in "premium pearl/chain bag jewellery" around ~$50–$85 with meaningful review counts (e.g., a pearl luxury bag charm market page shows a bag chain listing at $81.35 with 780 reviews).

Above $100, Etsy shows viability but weaker "mass conversion" proof: the strongest signs become favourites, scarcity, and "art object" reviews rather than high item-review counts (e.g., $155 charm with 974 favourites; $104.91 pouch with 22 reviews and 2,448 favourites).

For H1 handbag-silhouette charms specifically, Etsy market pages make the category anchor explicit: "mini Birkin handbag charm" results commonly show $11–$44 items with hundreds of reviews, reinforcing that Caryina's €95–€120 will require clear premium signalling to overcome the prevailing expectation that "mini handbag charms are cheap."

## Section 2 — Pricing model patterns that move listings into the €80+ zone

Across the Etsy artisan-premium tier, there are consistent observable pricing structures that help sellers sustain higher prices.

Personalisation is the most common "premium lever," but it has tiers. At the craft-forward end, personalisation is tied to process and materials (hot foil stamping options; brass hardware; named artisan), as seen in NitmoiStudio's monogram and foil options.

At the mass end, personalisation becomes commoditised and primarily supports conversion at low prices under cyclical markdowns (e.g., Dreamerleathergoods and JoylleDesign both use personalisation with deep discounting and high item-review volumes at $17–$26).

"Made-to-order" premium is frequently paired with explicit scarcity or urgency signals. TRIMleather frames its AirPods case as made-to-order and offers initials customisation, while Etsy also surfaces "only X left" and "in cart" signals on multiple premium-coded listings.

TyransLeatherShop's orchid charm goes a step further by stating explicit add-on pricing inside the personalisation box (charging more for extra orchids/petals), which is a clear example of "customisation ladder" pricing psychology in the artisan tier.

Material and construction upgrades are used as a higher-price tier signal. PEGAI's $99 python AirPods case explicitly frames premium in terms of hide selection ("top 3% full-grain hides"), interior lining, and closure mechanics (suede lining; magnetic closure).

However, MARKET-03 evidence also shows that "Italian veg-tan leather" and "brass" language appears even in mid-to-lower priced listings (e.g., a ~$44 leather case claiming "Italian vegetable tanned leather," YKK snap button, and brass). This indicates that premium claims alone are not sufficient; buyers need credible proof and trust signals.

Bundle pricing was not a prominent norm in the "bag charm + AirPods holder" intersection. Searches for combined "bag charm + AirPods" frequently return patterns, novelty charms, or low-priced combined concepts rather than premium artisan bundles, implying that a coherent Caryina H1+H2 set could be meaningfully differentiating rather than conformist.

---

## Section 3 — Discounting, shipping architecture, and platform constraints affecting perceived value

Discounting is a dominant conversion mechanic on Etsy in adjacent categories, particularly for AirPods cases. Etsy surfaces large "original price → sale price" anchors and sometimes adds urgency meta-text like "New markdown! Biggest sale in 60+ days" on listings with substantial review volumes (e.g., Dreamerleathergoods at 92 item reviews).

Discounting also exists in premium bag jewellery (SPECSET pearl charm showing markdowns in snapshots) and in high-velocity non-silhouette charm categories.

Platform mechanics strongly influence sticker prices and price presentation. Etsy's fees documentation confirms that sellers pay a 6.5% transaction fee applied to the item price plus delivery and gift wrap.

Etsy also documents Offsite Ads fees—12% or 15% of the order total for attributed orders (with a per-order cap)—a cost that can quietly force sellers either to raise list prices or to accept weaker margins on ad-driven sales.

For Italy specifically, Etsy's help materials note a Regulatory Operating fee applies to sellers in several countries including Italy (rate varies by location).

Shipping is not a secondary detail on Etsy; it materially affects conversion and search visibility, especially in the US. Etsy's help content states shoppers are "20% more likely" to complete purchase when an item ships free, and that certain US domestic listings with shipping prices above $6 may appear lower in US search results (with exceptions by listing type).

Etsy also pushes a formal "free delivery guarantee" for US buyers for orders at $35+ and provides tools to reprice listings to absorb postage.

For an Italy-based brand testing on Etsy, this implies that H1/H2 pricing cannot be separated from a shipping strategy: either (a) bake shipping into the list price and present "free shipping," or (b) accept that high visible postage may depress conversion for US buyers.

## Section 4 — Price-quality signalling buyers respond to above $79

For H2, buyer reviews show that "premium" is often justified in three practical dimensions: durability/craft, closure security, and fit/port alignment.

TRIMleather's own listing uses "full-grain oil-waxed Italian cowhide" and "sturdy brass clasp" language, and the limited item reviews include trust statements ("my go to… for more than a decade"), which is a strong premium justification signal.

At the commoditised end, JoylleDesign's listing has 79 reviews but a low 3.4/5 average, with explicit complaints including non-arrival ("Item never arrived received zero help") and construction failure ("It comes apart and feels unusable"). This is a key "exploit-able weakness" for any premium entrant: delivery reliability, customer service, and build quality remain fragile in high-volume low-price shops.

Dreamerleathergoods shows 92 reviews at $25.83+ (on sale), but a recent review notes "It came a bit late," reinforcing that delivery reliability is a recurring pain point even among highly-reviewed listings; a second-order premium cue is therefore "predictable delivery + proactive expectation setting."

For H1-adjacent premium charm purchases, the clearest available buyer vocabulary for justifying $150+ spending is art object + uniqueness + elevates the bag. In MattLucasSingapore's $155 leather charm listing, buyers describe it as "a work of art," "very high quality," and emphasise that it makes an "ordinary bag… shine."

At ~$100, TyransLeatherShop's Taiyaki pouch reviews surface premium risk factors relevant to Caryina's micro-bag construction too: customers mention made-to-order speed frustrations and note leather scratches caused by hardware during transit—both directly actionable for Caryina via packaging engineering and hardware-to-leather scratch prevention.

A critical pricing insight from MARKET-03 is that "material claims" are becoming commoditised on Etsy in both charms and tech cases—Italian leather, brass, and "premium" appear across wide price bands. This makes photography, craft proof, and trust proof the true differentiators for sustaining €95–€120 on Etsy rather than drifting into "it's just Etsy" price compression.

## Section 5 — Recommended benchmark ranges and launch price hypotheses

The recommendations below prioritise a single launch price per SKU for Etsy, plus an explicitly different price window for the Positano tourist channel (Positano boutique + Brikette Hostel). Confidence is driven by how directly the evidence matches Caryina's exact format (handbag-silhouette micro-bag charm).

**H1 Etsy launch price recommendation: €99 (Medium confidence)**

The highest proven Etsy conversion density in "premium-coded" adjacent charm spend sits around ~$70–$80 (SexylittleVintage at $79; YLSecretHeart designs at $76.88; TRIMleather's functional-premium at $69.90).

At the same time, Etsy does show conversion above $100 for charm-adjacent "micro object" formats ($104.91 pouch with 22 reviews; $155 charm with 974 favourites), implying €99 is not inherently impossible—especially because MARKET-01 established a gap for premium handbag-silhouette execution even if the silhouette category is price-anchored low.

€99 is therefore a pragmatic "premium but testable" price: close enough to the demonstrated high-velocity band to keep conversion plausible, while still signalling "this is not the €15 Etsy version."

**H2 Etsy launch price recommendation: €89 (Medium–Low confidence)**

Etsy's revealed preference for AirPods cases is strongly concentrated at $20–$50 with heavy markdowns and very high review counts; this implies Etsy's "default" willingness-to-pay for an AirPods case is far below €80.

To hold €89, Caryina's H2 must be sold as "a micro-bag charm that happens to fit AirPods"—closer to PEGAI's $99 fashion-tech framing (suede lining, magnetic closure, keychain attachment) than to the monogram/engraving commodity tier.

**Amalfi / Amalfi Coast tourist channel range: €110–€140 for H1; €90–€120 for H2 (Medium–Low confidence)**

Comparable in-destination artisan pricing supports €100+ for local craft purchases: sandals marketed as Positano/Amalfi artisan products show prices like €99 and €150–€155, indicating that €100–€150 is a normal "premium artisan" spend band in the region for physical goods.

A CB Positano boutique profile covered by Financial Times shows dresses priced €98–€328 and accessories priced around €39–€68, reinforcing that tourists will spend €100+ on "meaningful Positano pieces," though it does not directly benchmark bag-charm pricing.

Because Caryina's items are smaller than sandals and dresses, the "tourist premium" for €110–€140 is plausible but not proven; it depends heavily on the strength of the origin story, packaging, and the object's perceived luxury ("this reads like a mini Birkin, not a coin purse").

**Key pricing risks to explicitly manage during the test**

The biggest risk for H1 is that the handbag-silhouette category is aggressively anchored by sub-$30 "mini Birkin charm" listings with high review counts; Caryina must not look interchangeable with these to sustain €99–€120.

The biggest risk for H2 is that buyers have abundant "leather + monogram" alternatives under $50 with massive review proof; without fashion-object framing, €89–€100 is likely to feel "too high for Etsy."

A third risk is discount expectation: many high-volume tech-case listings convert under perpetual markdowns; if Caryina never discounts, it may need even stronger photography/craft credibility to offset "no sale badge" friction.
