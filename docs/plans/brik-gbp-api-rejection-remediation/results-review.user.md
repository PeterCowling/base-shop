# Results Review

## Observed Outcomes

Pending — check back after TASK-01 sign-off and first monthly maintenance session. Expected: Google Hotel Free Listing plan triggered within 5 business days of sign-off; manual GBP maintenance cadence adopted as standard monthly practice.

## Standing Updates

- `docs/plans/brikette-seo-traffic-growth/plan.md` (Observability section): Should note that GBP Insights monitoring is manual-only — the API track is formally closed. Update recommended but not blocking.
- `docs/plans/brikette-seo-traffic-growth/task-16-gbp-audit.md`: No update needed — the API rejection was already anticipated there (case # was filed in that task).

## New Idea Candidates

- None.

## Standing Expansion

No standing expansion: this plan is a documentation-only closure artifact. No new standing docs warranted. Monthly Log in TASK-02 checklist is the ongoing operational record.

## Intended Outcome Check

- **Intended:** Close the GBP API application track with a documented decision; establish manual GBP maintenance cadence; confirm Google Hotel Free Listing plan is unblocked.
- **Observed:** Pending — TASK-01 sign-off outstanding; TASK-02 checklist complete.
- **Verdict:** Partially Met
- **Notes:** Both artifacts produced and Mode 3 review passed. Outcome blocked on TASK-01 operator sign-off (deadline 2026-03-04). Hotel Free Listing plan not yet triggered (requires TASK-01 sign-off first). Will move to Met when sign-off and Hotel Free Listing plan are confirmed.
