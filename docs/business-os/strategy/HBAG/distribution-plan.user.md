# Distribution Plan — Caryina (HBAG)

## A) Channel List

| Channel | Type | Cost/Effort | ICP Fit Rationale |
|---------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Caryina website (new app) | DTC own-site | Medium | Primary brand-owned conversion surface; enables SEO, email capture, and drop mechanics that marketplaces can't support; demand already proven via WhatsApp orders |
| Etsy | Marketplace | Low | Primary ICP (women 27–42, LV/Gucci-tier bags) actively searches Etsy for artisan accessories; active sub-market at €80–€150; no infrastructure required to list |
| Instagram + TikTok (organic + DM-to-buy) | Social organic | Low | Primary ICP discovers bag charms via TikTok/Instagram (10,000%+ search growth); "DM to buy" CTA requires no storefront; demand probe with zero channel cost |

## B) Fatal Blocker Check

No fatal blockers at assessment stage. Operational prerequisites noted for planning:

| Channel | Prerequisite | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Caryina website | New app to be built | Build required before launch |
| Etsy | Shop creation required (no Caryina/HBAG Etsy shop exists) | To do before launch |
| Instagram + TikTok | Separate Caryina accounts required (not yet created) | To do before launch |

## C) Launch Priority

| Priority | Channel | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Primary | Caryina website | Brand-owned DTC surface; demand proven via WhatsApp; move orders off WhatsApp onto owned channel |
| Secondary | Etsy | Marketplace reach; runs in parallel once shop created |
| Tertiary | Instagram + TikTok | Discovery and demand probe; drives traffic to website and Etsy |
