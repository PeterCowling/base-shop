# Reflection Debt — Reception App UI Polish

## What needs to be done

The `results-review.user.md` for this build has stubs that need filling in once the changes are live and staff have been using the updated screens.

Specifically, update:
1. **Observed Outcomes** — note any feedback from staff on the visual changes (gradient backgrounds, mode banners, stat panels, loading skeletons)
2. **Intended Outcome Check** — fill in `Observed:` and `Verdict:` fields based on actual usage

## Where to find it

Open `docs/plans/reception-ui-screen-polish/results-review.user.md` (or the archived copy if the plan has been moved).

## Deadline

Complete by **5 March 2026**. After this date, new reception app build cycles from the same owner scope will be held until this review is filed.
