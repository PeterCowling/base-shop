# CMS Blocks

Reusable content blocks for the page builder. Each block accepts optional
`width`, `height`, `margin` and `padding` props so editors can control layout
per instance. Blocks that render lists of items—such as `ProductGrid`,
`ProductCarousel` and `RecommendationCarousel`—also support `minItems` and
`maxItems` to clamp how many entries are shown at different viewport sizes.
