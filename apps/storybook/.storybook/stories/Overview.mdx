# Base Shop â€” Storybook Overview

Docs-only homepage for quick orientation

This Storybook showcases our UI package and composition stories used across the Shop/CMS apps. It includes MSW-backed data scenarios, theme tokens, viewport presets, and a curated CI subset for fast validation.

## Getting Started

- Start: `pnpm storybook` (port 6006)
- CI subset: `pnpm storybook:ci` (port 6007)
- Compose multiple Storybooks: `pnpm storybook:composed` (expects refs on 6006/6008/6010)

## Global Toolbar

- Tokens: switch design token themes (`base`, `brandx`).
- Scenario: controls MSW fixtures (featured/new/bestsellers/etc.).
- Locale & Currency: updates `lang` and price rendering.
- Network/Net Error: simulate latency and 500s for handlers.

These map to `window.__SB_GLOBALS__` and drive MSW handlers via `mapDataStateToMsw()`.

## Layout & Viewports

- Custom viewports (`desktop`, `tablet`, `mobile1`, `mobile2`) under the viewport addon.
- Backgrounds: quick switch between App/Canvas/Dark.

## Where Things Live

- UI component stories: `packages/ui/src/components/**/**/*.stories.tsx`
- Composition docs/stories (PDP/PLP/Homepage): `.storybook/stories/*.mdx|*.stories.tsx`
- MSW handlers for stories: `.storybook/msw/handlers.ts`
- Global decorators and toolbar: `.storybook/preview.tsx`

## Writing Stories

- Prefer CSF stories colocated with components; add a Matrix suite for complex states (`*.Matrix.stories.tsx`).
- Include common states where applicable: `Default`, `Empty`, `Loading`, `Error`, plus RTL/mobile coverage in Matrix.
- Use `parameters: { providers: { cart: true } }` to opt into the mocked `CartProvider`.

## Tips

- Docs pages like this one are MDX-only and have no component. Use them for intro pages or process notes.
- Links: You can deep-link to stories via the URL query `?path=/story/<group>--<story>` or docs via `?path=/docs/<group>--docs`.

Happy building!
