Booking Requests, Authorised Channels, and Contract Formation","body":["2.1 Authorised booking channels and resale prohibition — Bookings must be made through our Website or an authorised OTA. Unauthorised resale of our accommodation inventory is prohibited. We may refuse or cancel requests we reasonably believe involve unauthorised resale or fraud.","2.2 How a Booking becomes confirmed — A Booking becomes a Confirmed Booking only when we issue written confirmation (by email, OTA confirmation, or OTA message thread). Until then, discussions (including in person or by phone) are informational only.","2.3 Declining Booking Requests — We may decline a Booking Request where necessary for lawful operation, safety, capacity/inventory constraints, failure to complete required verification or payment, suspected fraud, or breach of these Booking Terms or the House Rules. We will not decline bookings on unlawful discriminatory grounds.","2.4 Accuracy of details and communications — The Booker must provide accurate contact details (including a monitored email address). We send material booking communications to the contact details provided. If you booked through an OTA, we may communicate via the OTA message system and/or email.","2.5 Verification, fraud prevention, and authorisations — We may require identity and/or payment verification to prevent fraud (including confirmation that the Cardholder authorises charges). If required verification is not provided within a reasonable time, we may decline the Booking Request or cancel the Booking (and apply the applicable fee rules if it had already become a Confirmed Booking).","2.6 Booking size limits — Unless we agree otherwise in writing, the following limits apply: maximum stay length per Booking: 7 nights; maximum group size per Booking: 5 people. If larger requests are accepted, they may be structured as multiple bookings. Fee rules apply per Booking unless we confirm otherwise in writing.","2.7 Non‑transferability — Bookings are non‑transferable. The Booker name cannot be changed without our written approval. Guests listed on a Booking may be changed only with our written approval and subject to identity verification and capacity rules."]},"s3":{"title":"3. Rates, Inclusions, and Room Allocation","body":["3.1 What is included — Unless your Confirmed Booking states otherwise, accommodation includes: a bed/room for each Guest for the booked nights; standard linen as provided at check‑in (see House Rules for details); access to Communal Areas during your stay; access to shared bathrooms/showers subject to posted schedules (if any). Any additional services (e.g., breakfast, drinks, Wi‑Fi, luggage storage, fridge storage) may be complimentary or paid and may be subject to separate terms communicated on site or on the Website.","3.2 Room and bed allocation — We allocate room types based on your Confirmed Booking. For dormitories, beds are generally assigned on a first‑come selection basis unless we specify otherwise. Group bookings may be split across rooms due to availability.","3.3 Upgrades — If we provide an upgrade, it may be paid (where you agree in writing and we successfully take payment) or operational (where we temporarily place you in a different room for inventory reasons). If an upgrade is paid but payment fails, we may revert the Booking to the original room type (subject to availability)."]},"s4":{"title":"4. Payments, Deposits, and Preauthorisations","body":["4.1 Accepted payment methods — Accepted payment methods are: Visa and Mastercard; cash in EUR; bank transfer only from incorporated businesses.","4.2 When payment is due — Payment timing depends on the Rate Type and booking channel. Non‑Refundable Rate: full payment is due at booking (or at confirmation if we process payment manually). Refundable Rate: payment may be due at booking, at check‑in, or within a stated timeframe; we may require a preauthorisation/guarantee. Your Confirmed Booking will state the payment timing and rules applicable to your Rate Type.","4.3 Payments via OTAs — If you book through an OTA, your payment may be collected either by the OTA (as merchant of record) or Skylar SRL (as merchant of record). The merchant of record and applicable refund process will be indicated in your booking confirmation and/or the OTA booking page. Where the OTA is merchant of record, refund processing (if any) is handled by the OTA under its procedures.","4.4 Deposits and advance payments — If we take a deposit or advance payment, whether it is refundable depends on the Rate Type and the cancellation rules shown at booking and in your Confirmed Booking. We do not treat all deposits as automatically non‑refundable unless explicitly stated for that Rate Type.","4.5 Preauthorisations — We may preauthorise a payment card for amounts consistent with the accommodation price, the Security Deposit rule (Section 5), and/or charges reasonably anticipated under the Booking (e.g., late cancellation, no show, damages). A preauthorisation is not a final charge. Release timing depends on card issuer and processing bank."]},"s5":{"title":"5. Security Deposit and Safeguarding","body":["5.1 Security Deposit rule — We may require a Security Deposit for the duration of the stay of one night per Guest, taken as either a preauthorisation or cash deposit (permitted methods may vary by locale).","5.2 Use of Security Deposit — We may apply all or part of the Security Deposit to amounts owed under these Booking Terms or the House Rules, including: unpaid accommodation or extensions; damages or missing items; cleaning fees for excessive mess; penalties for serious House Rules breaches (where permitted); keycard/linen replacement where applicable. If costs exceed the Security Deposit, you remain responsible for the balance.","5.3 If we cannot obtain the Security Deposit — If we cannot obtain the Security Deposit by preauthorisation, we may accept cash or another acceptable method, or another Guest/Cardholder may provide it. If no acceptable Security Deposit is provided, we may refuse check‑in and treat the Booking under the No Show / cancellation rules applicable to the Rate Type."]},"s6":{"title":"6. Cancellations, Changes, No Shows, Early Departure","body":["6.1 How to request changes or cancellations — All cancellation or change requests must be made in writing to hostelpositano@gmail.com or via the OTA message system (if booked through an OTA).

Extensions are subject to availability and are treated as a new booking period (which may have a different Rate Type). We will confirm approved changes in writing. Until confirmed, the original Booking remains in effect.","6.5 No Show — If a Booking becomes a No Show, fees will apply according to the Rate Type and Appendix A. For Non‑Refundable Rates, this generally means no refund.","6.6 Early departure and unused nights — If you leave early after check‑in, this does not automatically create a refund. Any refund, credit, or waiver (if any) is governed by the Rate Type, whether we have confirmed a change/cancellation in writing, and any mandatory requirements of applicable law.","6.7 Termination for breach (eviction / refusal of continued stay) — If we terminate your stay due to a serious breach of these Booking Terms or the House Rules: you may be required to leave immediately; you may remain responsible for charges for unused nights as permitted by applicable law and consistent with the Rate Type; we may apply the Security Deposit to amounts owed and/or charge the Cardholder.
