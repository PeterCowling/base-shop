        "**SITA buses** run year-round to Positano (€2.50, 40-50 min) and Amalfi (€3.60, 90 min). Buses depart every 30-60 minutes from Circumvesuviana station; buy tickets at the station bar or tabacchi before boarding. Peak summer routes can fill up, so arrive early.",
        "**Ferries to Positano and Amalfi** run April–October, weather permitting. Positano costs €18–22 (35 min), Amalfi €20–24 (50 min). Morning departures start around 08:30; last return typically 17:00–18:00. Book ahead on peak days via %LINK:ferrySchedules|ferry operators%.",
        "**Trains to Naples** (Circumvesuviana line) cost €3.90 and run hourly until ~22:30 (70 min). Trains are slower than buses but avoid coastal traffic and connect you directly to Pompeii (€2.90, 30 min).",
        "**Capri ferries** depart frequently in season (€20–25 each way, 20 min). Off-season services reduce but never stop completely."

        "**If you're passing through:** Sorrento makes an easy first or last stop. Arrive from Naples Airport via %LINK:naplesAirportPositanoBus|Curreri bus% (€10, 75 min, direct to Sorrento), then catch onward transport to Positano the same day or next morning.",

        "The historic center has pedestrian streets lined with lemon product shops, local ceramics, and inlaid woodwork artisans. Piazza Tasso is the main square; Marina Grande and Marina Piccola are the harbor areas with clifftop views. Via San Cesareo is the main shopping street—avoid buying limoncello near Piazza Tasso where prices are 2-3x higher.",
        "Most travelers treat Sorrento as a jumping-off point rather than a destination, spending 1-2 hours walking the center before moving on. If you stay overnight, sunset from Villa Comunale park is worthwhile (free entry, open until late), and dinner prices drop significantly away from the main square—head inland two blocks for authentic trattorias at half the tourist-zone cost.",
        "The Duomo (cathedral) is worth a quick look if you're passing; free entry and usually empty. Chiostro di San Francesco has a peaceful cloister garden (free) that's a good rest stop if you're waiting for transport connections.",
        "For a beach day from Sorrento, %LINK:reginaGiovannaBath|Regina Giovanna bath% is a 30-minute bus ride (€1.40) and offers a secluded cove with Roman ruins—fewer crowds than Positano's main beach and no entry fee. Bring water and snacks as there are no facilities."

        "**Choose Positano if:** You want the iconic cliffside setting and don't mind higher prices or stairs. Positano is more scenic but less practical for day trips beyond the coast.",
        "Many travelers split their time: 1-2 nights in Sorrento for arrivals/day trips, then move to %LINK:onlyHostel|Positano% for the coastal experience. %LINK:sorrentoPositanoBus|Sorrento to Positano by bus% is straightforward (40 min, €2.50)."

        "**Getting around town:** Sorrento is walkable but hilly. The town center is compact; allow 10-15 minutes walking from the train station to Marina Piccola (ferry dock). Buses to Marina Grande beach leave from Piazza Tasso (€1.40, every 30 min).",
        "**Wi-Fi and connectivity:** Most cafes and accommodation offer free Wi-Fi. Cell coverage is good throughout town. The train station has charging points if you need to wait for connections."
