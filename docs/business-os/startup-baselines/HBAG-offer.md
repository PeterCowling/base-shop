# Caryina (HBAG) — Offer Design (MARKET-06)

**Executive summary:** Caryina is a premium artisan bag accessories brand, designed in Positano, Italy. The 90-day demand test launches two products on Etsy: H1, a structured mini-bag worn as a bag charm at €99, and H2, the same body sized to hold AirPods Pro / AirPods 4 at €89 — framed as a micro-bag fashion accessory, not a tech case. Both occupy the uncontested €80–€150 artisan-premium tier between Etsy mid-market (<€60) and accessible luxury (Coach $95+, Miu Miu €200+). The offer is validated by MARKET-01–05 intelligence: competitor gap confirmed, demand active, pricing benchmarked, channel mechanics mapped. Three operational blockers remain before listing launch: Etsy Italy seller verification, photography passing a "reads €99" perception gate, and shipping/duties architecture for the US.

## Section 1: ICP Segmentation

### ICP-A: The Considered Bag Buyer (Primary — H1 launch ICP)

**Demographics:**
- Age: 27–42
- Geography: EU + North America primary; Amalfi Coast tourists (ICP-C) seasonal overlay
- Income: owns at least one aspirational handbag at LV/Gucci entry tier (€600–€1,500+); comfortable at €80–€150 for a considered accessory
- Device: mobile-first — discovers via TikTok/Instagram Reels; purchases via Etsy or direct website

**Psychographics:**
- Wants personal expression through bag accessories — something that reads as genuinely crafted, not mass-produced
- Quality that "reads real" in hand and in photos; deliberates 3–7 days at this price point
- "Quiet fashion" sensibility: sophisticated, not showy; curated, not cluttered
- The bag charm trend is an entry point — she wants the piece she'll still use after the trend cycles out
- Aware of the artisan premium tier; frustrated that most Etsy options are too cheap-looking and branded options are €200+

**Jobs-to-be-done:**
- Functional: add a considered accessory that makes her bag feel personal and complete
- Emotional: feel like her look is edited, not overdone — "one detail, chosen well"
- Social: earn unprompted comments — "where did you get that?" — from people who recognise quality

**Buying triggers:**
- Sees the bag charm trend on her feed; wants in before it feels overdone
- Gets a new bag and wants to build a look around it
- Gifting occasion — treat herself, or a considered gift from ICP-B

---

### ICP-B: Gift Buyer (Secondary — transacts for ICP-A)

**Demographics:**
- Age: 25–55; purchasing for someone who fits ICP-A
- Occasion: birthdays, Christmas, milestone self-treats; "I need something considered for someone who has taste"

**Psychographics:**
- Values brand story and presentation — packaging does significant work in this use case
- The €89–€99 price point is in the "special but not reckless" gift zone
- Wants something not available in every high street store

**Jobs-to-be-done:**
- Functional: find a gift that fits into her recipient's existing aesthetic
- Emotional: feel like the gift shows real thought, not a safe fallback
- Social: be the person who found the hidden artisan gem

**Buying triggers:**
- Etsy gift search ("artisan bag charm gift", "leather accessories gift for her")
- Instagram/TikTok discovery → saved → revisited at gifting occasion
- "Rare find" and "only X left" Etsy social proof signals

---

### ICP-C: Amalfi Tourist (Seasonal — H3 channel, June–Sept)

**Demographics:**
- Age: 30–55; international tourist visiting Amalfi Coast
- Spend profile: premium souvenir buyer; fashion/accessories = 12.2% of Italy tourist spend (2024)
- Context: physically present in Positano; Brikette hostel or boutique consignment display

**Psychographics:**
- Buys artisan goods in-destination as part of the travel experience
- "I bought this in Positano" is the purchase rationale — provenance is the value
- The leather sandal (€100–€250) is the Positano premium souvenir precedent; Caryina is the bag accessory equivalent

**Jobs-to-be-done:**
- Functional: acquire a location-specific, quality souvenir she'll actually use
- Emotional: take home a piece of the destination — something that tells a story
- Social: "this is what I found in Positano"

**Buying triggers:**
- Sees the product displayed in-destination; tactile + immediate; attachment visual proof
- Holiday gift shopping mode
- Provenance story — "designed here" — closes the purchase

## Section 2: Pain/Promise Mapping

### ICP-A (Considered Bag Buyer) — Pain/Promise Map

| Pain (Customer Language) | Promise (Our Solution) | Evidence Source |
|---|---|---|
| "I've been looking for the right bag charm but everything is either designer-expensive or looks cheap and generic" | The H1 mini-bag charm: structured, considered, €99. Artisan-quality craftsmanship in the tier between Etsy mid-market and accessible luxury — because the gap between "looks cheap" and "costs €200" shouldn't exist. | MARKET-01: premium mini-bag-silhouette charms absent on Etsy at €80–€150; MARKET-02: buyer demand active with reseller noise creating a quality premium opening |
| "I don't want something that piles onto my bag — I want one thing that makes the bag look complete" | One detail, chosen well. The H1 is designed to be the single considered accent — not the fifth charm — on a bag you already love. The silhouette echoes the bag rather than competing with it. | MARKET-02: 2026 aesthetic shift from "chaotic pile-on" to "one refined piece"; brand dossier personality: "curated, not cluttered" |
| "Is this actually good quality or will it look and feel cheap in person?" | Every listing shows a macro shot of the hardware, stitching edge, and material finish — not just a lifestyle hero. If it doesn't read as worth €99 in photos: we don't list it. Photography is gated before launch. | MARKET-03: photography and craft proof are the real differentiator at €80–€150; MARKET-05: photography perception gate is a pre-launch blocker |

### ICP-B (Gift Buyer) — Pain/Promise Map

| Pain (Customer Language) | Promise (Our Solution) | Evidence Source |
|---|---|---|
| "I want to give something considered but I don't know her taste well enough to pick a colour or style" | Giftable out of the box: tissue, ribbon, handwritten note from the designer. The presentation does the work. If it's not right: free exchange within 30 days — no forms, no drama. | MARKET-01: gift framing appears in top-performing Etsy listings (TRIMleather, SPECSET); MARKET-02: bag charms appear in holiday gift editorial |
| "Everything at this price feels like it's either mass-produced or too niche to find" | Designed in Positano, Italy. Not in every high-street window. Found via a considered search — or a considered gift from someone who knew where to look. | MARKET-04: Etsy is active gift discovery destination for this buyer; brand dossier: "Designed in Italy" is the authentic origin claim |

### ICP-C (Amalfi Tourist) — Pain/Promise Map

| Pain (Customer Language) | Promise (Our Solution) | Evidence Source |
|---|---|---|
| "I want to take something home from Positano but I don't want another cheap souvenir" | A mini-bag designed here, for here — with Amalfi imagery, sold where the story happens. The Positano equivalent of a made-to-measure leather sandal, for the bag you brought on holiday. | MARKET-02: leather sandal €100–€250 anchors in-destination artisan spend; MARKET-03: Amalfi tourist channel €110–€140 H1 is plausible |
| "Can I find something premium that isn't available online everywhere?" | H3 (Amalfi location variant) is in-destination only — not on Etsy. The location variant is specific to Amalfi and sold where the story happens. | Intake packet: H3 is seasonal, in-destination only, June–Sept; Brikette hostel + 1 Positano boutique consignment |

## Section 4: Positioning One-Pager

### Positioning Statement (Moore Template)

```
For fashion-conscious women 27–42 who own aspirational handbags and want to add
one considered accessory that makes the bag feel complete — at a craft price,
Caryina is a premium artisan bag accessories brand, designed in Positano, Italy,
that delivers a structured mini-bag charm at €99 — the considered detail
that reads as genuinely made, not mass-produced,
unlike Etsy mid-market sellers (no brand story, generic quality) or accessible-luxury brands
(Coach/Miu Miu at €200+, not within reach for a considered fashion buy),
because Caryina is designed by an artisan in Positano with real origin story,
premium craft proof in every photo, and a 30-day free exchange guarantee.
```

### Category Frame

- **Primary category**: artisan fashion accessories — bag charms and mini-bag accessories
- **Not positioned as**: novelty charm, tech accessory brand, children's accessory, or generic "bag charm" at €15
- **Copy constraint**: do not use "Birkin" in any public-facing listing, copy, or social content (IP/trade dress risk: 2025 Paris Judicial Court ruling affirmed shape protection)
- **Origin claim**: "Designed in Italy" — correct and authentic (Pete designs and curates from Positano). "Made in Italy" cannot be claimed (manufacturing is China-based).
- The bag charm trend is the entry point — Caryina will outlast the trend by owning the Italian-artisan-design positioning

### Competitive Frame

Customers compare Caryina against:
1. **Etsy artisan sellers** (€15–€80 range) — primary comparison at launch; Caryina differentiates on brand coherence, craft proof, photography, and the Positano origin story. Key risk: sub-$30 mini-bag silhouettes create strong price anchor. Mitigation: hero images must not resemble $11–$20 listing thumbnails.
2. **Coach bag charm** ($95) — accessible-luxury floor anchor; Caryina H1 at €99 is at parity or above depending on FX; the differentiator is artisan provenance + Etsy accessibility vs. mall brand
3. **Miu Miu / Loewe** (€200–€450) — aspirational ceiling; Caryina is "the craft quality at a real price"
4. **Hermès / Chanel AirPod cases** ($930 / $950) — H2 ultra-luxury ceiling; Caryina H2 is the artisan alternative at 10× lower price. Frame H2 as fashion object, not tech cover.

### Key Message and Brand Voice

**Tagline:** *Un solo dettaglio. Quello carino.* (One detail. The cute one.) — appears beneath the Caryina wordmark after the logo animation.

**Three core lines** (use one per asset; use all three for hero layouts):

| Line | Use when |
|---|---|
| **Made to be shown.** | Visibility — the accessory belongs on the bag, visible |
| **Considered detail.** | Positioning against charm pile-on — one piece, chosen well |
| **Use every day.** | Daily use, versatility, value — justifies €80–€150 as a keeper |

**Voice:** Conversational, not corporate. Short to medium sentences. Some technical detail is welcome (dimensions, material, compatibility) — but copy should never feel like a spec sheet. No "luxury", "premium", "exclusive", "statement piece", "must-have", or "turn heads" — show craft, don't claim it.

---

## Section 5: Pricing / Packaging Hypothesis

**THIS IS A HYPOTHESIS TO VALIDATE. Final prices depend on TASK-02 (supply chain cost confirmation).**

### Proposed Launch Prices

| Variant | Launch price | Confidence | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 bag charm (Etsy) | **€99** | Medium | Above the high-velocity $79–$80 Etsy band; below the "art object" tier where review density thins; pragmatic "premium but testable" price |
| H2 AirPod holder (Etsy) | **€89** | Medium–Low | Etsy AirPods case buyers are price-conditioned ($20–$50 with massive review volumes); €89 only holds if framed as fashion object not tech cover |
| H3 Amalfi tourist variant (in-destination) | **€110–€140** | Medium–Low | Amalfi artisan premium precedent (leather sandals €99–€155); confirmed by Positano FT boutique profile; depends on origin story strength and packaging |

### Pricing Model

One-time purchase. No subscription, no tiers at launch.

### Competitor Price Comparison (Q1 2026)

| Competitor | Price | Channel | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| SexylittleVintage | $79 | Etsy | ~3.7k shop reviews; ~14.4k sales; "one of a kind" framing; high-velocity |
| YLSecretHeart | $76.88 | Etsy | 655 reviews; 2.3k sales; "Kelly Bag Charms" keywording; high favourites |
| TyransLeatherShop | $72–$104.91 | Etsy | $104.91 Taiyaki pouch: 22 reviews, 2,448 favourites — "art object" behaviour above $100 |
| MattLucasSingapore | $155 | Etsy | 2 item reviews; 974 favourites; scarcity; "work of art" buyer language |
| SPECSET | $82.77 (on sale) | Etsy + DTC | ~818 Etsy reviews; bag jewellery (pearls/chain), not silhouette charm |
| TRIMleather | $69.90 | Etsy | ~2.5k reviews; H2 leather AirPods case; made-to-order; free shipping |
| PEGAI | $99 | Etsy | ~107k sales; H2 AirPod holder; US-only shipping — leaves EU gap open |
| KILLSPENCER | $55 | DTC | Artisan mid-market AirPod holder floor |
| Coach bag charm | $95 | DTC / department stores | Accessible-luxury floor anchor |
| Miu Miu bag charm | €200–€300 | DTC / boutiques | Aspirational ceiling for ICP-A |
| Hermès AirPod case | $930 | Boutiques | Ultra-luxury H2 ceiling — proves buyer exists |
| Chanel AirPod case | $950 | Boutiques | Ultra-luxury H2 ceiling |
| Sticky Zoo | €59.95–€117.95 | DTC | "Collectible drop" model; 18K hardware; French leather |
| String Ting | £65–£250 | DTC | Broad premium price ladder; "lifetime restring" positioning |
| **Caryina H1 (bag charm)** | **€99** | **Etsy** | **Target: above Coach, artisan-premium tier** |
| **Caryina H2 (AirPod holder)** | **€89** | **Etsy** | **Target: above KILLSPENCER; fashion-object framing essential** |
| **Caryina H3 (Amalfi)** | **€110–€140** | **In-destination** | **Location premium + in-person tactile proof** |

### Etsy Fee Stack (Italy-based seller at €99)

Approximate platform cost on a €99 H1 order (excluding Offsite Ads, shipping, product cost, and VAT on fees):
- 6.5% transaction fee: ~€6.44
- 4% + €0.30 payment processing: ~€4.26
- 0.32% Regulatory Operating fee: ~€0.32
- **Total platform take: ~€11.02 (≈11.1%)**
- Offsite Ads (if attributed): additional 15% = ~€14.85 per attributed order while shop is below $10k annual sales

Practical implication: at €99, after Etsy fees + €25–€35 estimated international shipping (Poste Italiane), a €35 COGS target leaves ~€18–€28 net contribution before packaging, returns, and taxes. Margin viability depends critically on TASK-02 (supplier cost confirmation).

### Pricing Rationale

1. **Competitive gap confirmed**: No brand coherently owns €80–€150 artisan-premium mini-bag-silhouette on Etsy at scale. MARKET-01 confirmed the gap; MARKET-03 benchmarked the viable conversion band.
2. **€99 is pragmatic premium**: Sits above the high-velocity $79–$80 Etsy artisan band, and below the "art object" tier (above $100) where review density thins and conversion requires stronger "tiny art" framing. MARKET-03 Medium confidence.
3. **Photography determines pricing viability**: Material claims ("Italian leather", "brass") are now commoditised on Etsy at all price bands. Craft proof through photography is the actual differentiator that sustains €99.
4. **H2 requires fashion framing**: At €89, H2 is viable only as a micro-bag charm — not as an AirPods case. Etsy's AirPods case default expectation is $20–$50 with massive review volumes. MARKET-03 Medium–Low confidence.
5. **Supply chain cost unknown**: TASK-02 determines price floor. If contribution margin at €89–€99 is below 35% after all costs, price must adjust upward before launch.

### Confidence Level

**MEDIUM (H1) / MEDIUM–LOW (H2).** MARKET-01–05 provide the strongest pre-launch evidence base yet. Three critical risks remain: (1) photography perception gate (TASK-06) unverified — if photos don't read €99, the test is invalid; (2) supply chain cost unconfirmed (TASK-02); (3) H2 framing risk — if buyers hear "AirPods case" first, €89 will feel like too much. Confidence moves to HIGH when ≥3 paid orders at launch price confirmed within 28 days with no systemic price-shock complaints.

### Validation Plan

1. **TASK-06 (gate):** Photography perception check — ≥3/5 cold reviewers must estimate ≥€80 for H1 hero photo before listing goes live
2. **28-day price-demand test:** List H1 at €99 and H2 at €89 on Etsy; success = ≥3 paid orders within 28 days
3. **Kill tests at Day 30** (from MARKET-05): if <3 paid orders with strong traffic + favourites/carts → price step test (€99 → €89 H1, €89 → €79 H2); if near-zero impressions → fix listing SEO/completeness before price change; if US duty complaints dominate messages → re-scope to EU/UK primary
4. **H2 two-frame test (by Day 30):** "micro-bag charm that holds AirPods" framing vs "AirPods holder" framing to isolate the fashion-object premium

## Section 6: Objection Map + Risk Reversal

| Objection | Response | Proof / Risk Reversal |
|---|---|---|
| "€99 for a bag charm feels like a lot" | "It's not a charm — it's a structured mini-bag you wear every day. At €99 it's less than a dinner out and it'll outlast the trend on a bag you already love. Considered detail, not impulse buy." | Contextualise against Coach bag charm ($95 anchor); 30-day free exchange removes commitment risk; brand dossier phrase: "Use every day" — justify as keeper piece |
| "I've never heard of this brand — can I trust a small maker?" | "We're designed in Positano, Italy — not a dropship operation. If it's not right within 30 days: free exchange. No forms, no drama. The handwritten note from the designer tells the story." | 30-day free exchange policy; handwritten note from Pete (artisan proof); Etsy platform review trust layer; origin story (Positano, designed by Pete) is authentic and verifiable |
| "Will it look cheap when it arrives? Etsy photos can be misleading" | "Every listing shows a hardware close-up, an edge-finish detail, and the product clipped on a real bag. We gate photography before listing: if it doesn't read as worth €99, we don't publish it." | Macro photography requirement (hardware, stitching, material texture); TASK-06 perception test gate; Etsy Buyer Protection layer |
| "What if it doesn't clip securely to my bag or scratches the strap?" | "Spring-clip carabiner fits any D-ring, O-ring, or standard strap attachment. We show it on a real bag in photos. If the hardware fails in 90 days of normal use: replacement at no cost." | 90-day hardware replacement guarantee; product photos show clip in use on a real handbag; clear attachment compatibility description in listing |
| "Is this actually made in Italy or is it shipped from China?" | "Designed in Positano, Italy — by Pete, the person who will write your note and pack your order. The product body is precision-sourced; we're honest about that in our listings. The design and curation are Italian." | "Designed in Italy" is the correct, honest claim; Pete is physically present in Positano; avoid "Made in Italy" (manufacturing is China-based — would be false advertising under Italian Law 166/2009) |
| "I'm worried about customs duties / surprise charges on delivery" | "For EU buyers: no customs — we ship as an EU-origin seller. For international orders (including the US): our shop policies clearly state applicable duty thresholds and we use tracked, insured shipping. Duties are a fixed, known cost — not a surprise." | Proactive US duty disclosure in listing copy and shop policies; US de minimis suspension (Feb 2026 executive order) means duties apply to all US parcels — disclose this clearly; consider EU/UK buyer focus in early test phase to protect new-shop reputation from duty complaints |
