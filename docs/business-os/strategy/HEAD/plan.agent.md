# Headband — Business Plan

## Strategy

### Current Focus (2026-02-11)

1. **First Outcome Lock-In** (Priority: High)
   - Status: New business scaffolded; no locked current-cycle outcome yet.
   - Next: Define one clear commercial outcome with baseline, target, deadline, owner, and decision link.

2. **Offer Definition** (Priority: High)
   - Status: Product proposition and differentiation are not yet finalized.
   - Next: Finalize offer statement and attach testable customer-value claims.
   - Artifact: `docs/business-os/strategy/HEAD/headband-90-day-launch-forecast-v1.agent.md`
   - Exec Summary: `docs/business-os/strategy/HEAD/headband-90-day-launch-forecast-v1-exec-summary.agent.md`

3. **Launch Signal Design** (Priority: Medium)
   - Status: No agreed launch metrics or stop/pivot threshold.
   - Next: Define demand, conversion, and margin proxy signals with weekly cadence.
   - Dry-run Evidence: `docs/business-os/strategy/HEAD/2026-02-11-week2-gate-dry-run.agent.md`
   - Action Backlog: `docs/business-os/strategy/HEAD/launch-readiness-action-backlog.agent.md`

## Risks

### Active Risks

- **Unclear Differentiation** (Severity: High, Added: 2026-02-11)
  - Source: Offer framing and value proposition remain broad.
  - Impact: Weak demand signal and low conversion confidence.
  - Mitigation: Define a narrow ICP and value claim before expansion.

- **Measurement Gap** (Severity: Medium, Added: 2026-02-11)
  - Source: No baseline metrics currently instrumented.
  - Impact: Decisions rely on opinion, not evidence.
  - Mitigation: Establish minimal weekly scorecard before major build work.
