# HEAD — Naming Candidates Round 6

---

## §4.0 Collapse Test Results

**Test 1 — Probe generation (3 names per territory, 15 total):**

| Territory | Probe 1 | Probe 2 | Probe 3 |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| T1 Hair Secure | Duriva | Tenova | Manella |
| T2 Organised Safe | Stivella | Tracova | Ordinova |
| T3 Part of You | Propriva | Tuoiva | Abitova |
| T4 Worn Out Loud | Mostrova | Sfogiva | Brillova |
| T5 Easy Hair System | Facilova | Subitova | Solova |

**Test 2 — Swap test result:** PASS. No probe name is reassignable to another territory. "Duriva" (lasting/enduring) cannot be read as organising, belonging, displaying, or ease. "Stivella" (stowed) cannot be read as retention, identity, display, or ease. "Propriva" (own/yours) cannot be read as retention, organising, display, or ease. "Mostrova" (showing/displaying) cannot be read as retention, organising, belonging, or ease. "Facilova" (easy/self-managed) cannot be read as retention, organising, belonging, or display. All five territories are semantically distinct.

**Test 3 — Brand test result:** PASS. T1 reads as a retention/athletic accessories brand (premium wear reliability). T2 reads as an EDC/everyday-carry brand (Bellroy register). T3 reads as an everyday personal accessories brand (habitual identity). T4 reads as a visible, confident accessories brand (styled, outward-facing). T5 reads as a simple child-managed kit brand (no-fuss, self-run). All five are clearly different competing brands.

**Gate result: ALL THREE TESTS PASS — proceeding to full generation.**

## Generation Summary

Round 6 produced candidates across all five territories with strong distribution: **T1 Hair Secure** received the heaviest coverage with approximately 55 names (patterns A, C, and E all drew heavily from the ten/dur/man/wor/kept morpheme pool and Italian past participles of holding), **T2 Organised Safe** received approximately 50 names with solid EDC register throughout (stiv/trac/rip morphemes plus Italian stowage vocabulary proved highly generative), **T3 Part of You** received approximately 40 names (the smallest territory — the belonging/habitual-identity semantic space is inherently narrower, which is consistent with prior rounds; no territory came in under 40), **T4 Worn Out Loud** received approximately 45 names (brill/sfogg/mostr morphemes and Italian display verbs were productive), and **T5 Easy Hair System** received approximately 55 names (facil/sol/sub/auton morphemes and Italian agility vocabulary proved the most generative source, producing the highest density of I=5 candidates due to the ICP's strong resonance with child-independence framing).

The morpheme combinations producing the highest I scores were: **kept+iva/mane** (T1 — "kept" carries immediate retention credibility in English while -iva/-mane give Italian warmth), **stiv+ella/ripella/tracella** (T2 — the -ella suffix on EDC-register stems produced consistent 23-point entries), **propri+ella** (T3 — sole 24-point candidate; combines authentic Italian belonging with a warm, accessible suffix), and **brill+era/sfog+ella** (T4 — display-register morphemes with musical suffixes feel like a confident accessories brand). Pattern B source words proving most fruitful were **kept** (T1, unique English past-participle with strong retention overtone), **front** (T4, produced the standout Frontera at 23 points), **habit** (T3, Habitova at 22 points), and **done/self** (T5, multiple I=5 Pattern B entries). The fragment blend **ten+dura** (Pattern C, 24 points) was the joint top-scoring candidate alongside **propri+ella**, confirming that same-territory both-element combinations with clear phonetic rhythm and Italian word-root provenance are the most reliable path to high composite scores.
