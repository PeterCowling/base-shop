# Pattern Reflection — Reception Stock Explained/Unexplained Variance Split

## Patterns

None identified.

No recurring deterministic or ad-hoc patterns emerged from this build. TASK-01 code was bundled into a concurrent agent commit (xa-uploader) — this is a known concurrent-agent behaviour pattern already tracked in the startup loop and does not represent a new pattern from this plan.

## Access Declarations

None identified.

All build work was confined to local source files and test utilities. No external APIs, MCP tools, or credentials were required. No mid-build access discoveries.
