# Measurement Plan — Caryina (HBAG)

## A) Tracking Setup

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Primary tracking tool/method | GA4 (website) + Etsy dashboard + manual order log spreadsheet |
| Instagram/TikTok | Native analytics + manual DM enquiry count |
| Setup feasibility | Conditional — GA4 setup required at website build time; Etsy dashboard available once shop created; manual log available immediately |

## B) Key Metrics

| Metric | Capture method | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| Paid orders (units sold) | Website (GA4 ecommerce) + Etsy dashboard + manual log | Weekly |
| Net revenue (€) | Website + Etsy dashboard + manual log | Weekly |
| Website sessions | GA4 / Plausible (confirm at build time) | Weekly |
| Etsy listing views | Etsy dashboard | Weekly |

## C) Success Thresholds

| Horizon | "Working" threshold | Reassessment trigger |
|---|---|---|
| 30 days | ≥5 paid orders via website or Etsy | — |
| 60 days | — | <2 orders/month via owned channels → pause and replan |

## D) Data Collection Feasibility

| Check | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GDPR/privacy compliance | ⚠️ Requires action at build time | Website needs cookie consent and privacy policy before launch; Etsy and social platforms handle their own data; manual log is internal only |
| Tooling availability | ⚠️ Requires setup | GA4 to be configured at website build time; Etsy dashboard live once shop created; manual log immediate |
