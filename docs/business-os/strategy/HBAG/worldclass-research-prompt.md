## (a) Business Context

Business: HBAG
Business type: Premium fashion accessories DTC brand. Sells Italian-designed bag accessories — charms, bag holders, and micro accessories — at €80–€150 per unit. The brand trades as Caryina. Designed in Positano, Amalfi Coast, Italy. Italian provenance is a genuine and central differentiator. Founder-led small operation; demand already proven via WhatsApp orders before the website launched.
Sales channels: Direct-to-consumer website (caryina.com, built on Next.js/React, hosted on Cloudflare) is the launch-primary channel. Etsy and social (TikTok/Instagram) are planned next steps once direct-site momentum is established.
Discovery model: TikTok and Instagram are the primary discovery channels. Visitors arrive from social scroll with aesthetic intent and are in a 3–7 day consideration cycle before purchasing. Mobile is the dominant device for both discovery and purchase.
Target audience: Women approximately 27–42 who own one or more bags at LV/Gucci entry tier (€600–€1,500+). They want personal expression through bag accessories that reads as genuinely crafted, not mass-produced. Gift buyers (purchasing for women in this profile) are a secondary audience.
Brand identity: Strawberry milk (warm soft pink) and light warm sage colour palette. Typography: Cormorant Garamond (headings) + DM Sans (body). Sophisticated, curated, confident — owns the craft quality story without over-justifying the price.
Operator-stated goal version: 2
Goal set on: 2026-02-28

## (b) Singular Goal (verbatim)

Singular goal: "Caryina's direct website should generate its first €1,000 in revenue: the site is fully launch-ready with a working purchase flow, a cold visitor arriving from TikTok or Instagram trusts the shop enough to buy at €80–€150, and the launch is tracked well enough to know which products and channels drove the first sales — building the foundation to expand to Etsy with momentum."

## (c) Domain-by-Domain Research Instructions

#### Launch Readiness

Context: Whether the site is actually ready to accept and fulfil a real order today. Covers the end-to-end purchase flow (product page → checkout → payment → order confirmation), payment provider integration, order notification and fulfilment handoff, error states, and any blockers that would prevent a stranger from successfully completing a purchase. Excludes visual design quality and marketing content (see First Visitor Conversion).

Reference points provided by operator:
- Shopify launch checklist — systematic pre-launch verification of payment, shipping, taxes, and test orders
- Gorgias launch readiness — confirms support channels, order routing, and post-purchase flows before going live
- Stripe Atlas DTC launch — payment methods live, webhooks tested, refund flow confirmed
- By Far DTC launch — direct website fully operable before any paid or social traffic sent

Research task:
For this domain, identify:
1. What does world-class look like right now (2025–2026)? Name 3–5 specific exemplars with concrete evidence of what makes them world-class in this domain.
2. What are the key indicators that distinguish world-class from merely good? List 5–8 measurable or observable indicators.
3. What is the minimum threshold — the lowest standard that could still be considered competitive — for a fashion accessories DTC brand of this type and scale?
4. What are the most common gaps between current-practice DTC fashion accessories operators and world-class in this domain?

#### First Visitor Conversion

Context: Whether a cold visitor arriving from TikTok or Instagram — with no prior awareness of Caryina — trusts the shop and completes a purchase at €80–€150. Covers trust signals for an unknown brand, product presentation credibility, mobile UX from landing to checkout, and friction reduction at the buy decision. The primary visitor has a 3–7 day consideration cycle and is on mobile. Excludes post-purchase flows and measurement (see Launch Measurement).

Reference points provided by operator:
- Mejuri DTC launch — unknown brand to €50M via trust-forward product pages and frictionless mobile checkout
- Astrid & Miyu — cold social traffic converted via dense trust stack (reviews, warranty, returns) near CTA
- Daisy London — risk reversal and gifting clarity that converts a first-time visitor at ~£100
- Monica Vinader — proof-of-quality language (material specs, warranty) that justifies price for an unknown brand

Research task:
For this domain, identify:
1. What does world-class look like right now (2025–2026)? Name 3–5 specific exemplars with concrete evidence of what makes them world-class in this domain.
2. What are the key indicators that distinguish world-class from merely good? List 5–8 measurable or observable indicators.
3. What is the minimum threshold — the lowest standard that could still be considered competitive — for a fashion accessories DTC brand of this type and scale?
4. What are the most common gaps between current-practice DTC fashion accessories operators and world-class in this domain?

#### Launch Measurement

Context: Whether the operator can tell, after the first sales arrive, which products sold, which channels drove buyers, and what the conversion funnel looked like. Covers GA4 or equivalent event tracking, order attribution, and the minimum viable measurement setup needed to make an informed decision about what to double down on — including what to bring to Etsy. Excludes the purchase flow itself (see Launch Readiness) and trust/UX (see First Visitor Conversion).

Reference points provided by operator:
- GA4 e-commerce tracking — purchase events, product impressions, and funnel drop-off visible from day one
- Shopify Analytics — source/medium attribution on first orders to identify which social channel converted
- Triple Whale (DTC attribution) — social-first brands use this to see TikTok vs Instagram contribution
- Linjer DTC launch — measurement set up before launch so first-week data informs restock and channel decisions

Research task:
For this domain, identify:
1. What does world-class look like right now (2025–2026)? Name 3–5 specific exemplars with concrete evidence of what makes them world-class in this domain.
2. What are the key indicators that distinguish world-class from merely good? List 5–8 measurable or observable indicators.
3. What is the minimum threshold — the lowest standard that could still be considered competitive — for a fashion accessories DTC brand of this type and scale?

## (d) Required Output Format

The result of this research must be saved as a Markdown document with the following structure.

Frontmatter:
```
---
schema_version: worldclass-benchmark.v1
business: HBAG
goal_version: 2
generated_at: <YYYY-MM-DD when research was run>
domains:
  - id: launch-readiness
    name: Launch Readiness
  - id: first-visitor-conversion
    name: First Visitor Conversion
  - id: launch-measurement

```

Body: one top-level section per domain, using EXACTLY this heading format:
`## [<domain_id>] <Domain Name>`

Under each domain section, include ALL FOUR of these subsections:

### Current Best Practice
<2–4 paragraph description of what world-class looks like in this domain right now, with named exemplars>

### Exemplars
<Bullet list of 3–5 named exemplars with a one-sentence description of what makes each world-class in this domain>

### Key Indicators
<Bullet list of 5–8 measurable or observable indicators that distinguish world-class from merely good>

### Minimum Threshold
<1–2 sentences: the lowest bar a fashion accessories DTC brand of this type and scale must clear to be considered competitive in this domain>

Do not add extra sections. Do not merge domains. If a domain has no strong exemplars available, note that explicitly in the Exemplars section rather than omitting it.

## (e) Constraints for This Research

All findings, exemplars, and recommendations must be compatible with the following constraints:

- Price point €80–€150 — benchmark references must be independent premium DTC brands, not LVMH-tier luxury houses
- Mobile-first — TikTok and Instagram are the primary discovery channels; desktop experience is secondary
- Founder-led small operation — world-class benchmarks must be achievable without a large team or agency budget
- Italian design provenance (Positano) — a genuine brand differentiator that should be legible in trust and conversion signals
- No physical retail — the website carries full conversion responsibility; there is no store to fall back on
- Direct website is the launch channel — Etsy is a planned next step once direct-site momentum is established; do not scope recommendations for Etsy

Research that violates these constraints (e.g. recommending enterprise analytics stacks or luxury-house production budgets) should be explicitly flagged as out-of-scope and replaced with the closest in-scope alternative.
