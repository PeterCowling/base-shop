# Operator Evidence — HEAD (ASSESSMENT-06)

## A) Launch and Operational Context

| Field | Value | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Launch surface | pre-website | confirmed |
| Execution posture | speed-to-first-sales; direct sales execution before platform/CMS work | confirmed |
| Primary time constraint | speed-to-first-sales is non-negotiable | confirmed |
| Hard stop conditions | platform-cleanup work must not delay first sale | confirmed |

## B) Inventory and Product Readiness

| Field | Value | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Product 1 stock status | purchased | confirmed |
| In-stock date (target) | TBD | pending |
| Sellable units (launch) | TBD | pending |
| Compatibility matrix | not yet | pending |
| Known sourcing constraints | none identified | confirmed |

## C) Commercial Architecture

| Field | Value | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Pricing model | TBD (single vs bundle undecided) | pending |
| Indicative price range | TBD | pending |
| Payment provider (launch market — Italy) | TBD | pending |
| Returns policy | TBD | pending |

## D) Channel Pre-Decisions

| Decision | Value | Decision ref |
|---|---|---|
| Primary channel surface | own-site DTC primary; constrained marketplace probes for evidence capture | DEC-HEAD-CH-01 |
| Amazon | deferred unless trigger conditions reopen the decision | DEC-HEAD-CH-01 |

## E) Open Evidence Gaps

| Gap | Why needed | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Exact in-stock date | Required for launch timing and spend planning | critical |
| Sellable units (launch quantity) | Required for CAC guardrails and stockout risk modelling | critical |
| Processor compatibility matrix | Required to reduce wrong-buy and return risk; must cover Cochlear / MED-EL / AB main processor families | critical |
| Final pricing model (single vs bundle) | Required for contribution margin and CAC guardrails | high |
| Indicative price range | Required for forecasting and positioning | high |
| Payment provider for Italy | Required for checkout conversion confidence | high |
| Returns policy and SLA | Required for trust, compliance, and support readiness | high |
