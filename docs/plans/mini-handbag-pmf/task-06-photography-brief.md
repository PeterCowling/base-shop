# TASK-06 — Photography Brief

**Target:** 9 shots minimum (3 per variant) + 1 perception test
**Format:** 2000×2000px minimum, square crop preferred for Etsy

---

## Before You Shoot

**What makes or breaks premium product photos:**
- Natural light (window) or diffused lamp — never flash directly on the bag
- Background: white card, linen, marble tile, or dark wood. No busy surfaces
- Keep the bag clean — no fingerprints on hardware, no lint on fabric
- Shoot at the bag's level, not from above

---

## H1 — Bag Charm (lead variant — best effort here)

| Shot | Setup | What to show |
|---|---|---|
| **H1-A** *(lead shot)* | Clip the mini bag onto the strap of a full-size handbag. Light from left window. | Mini bag hanging naturally, full body visible, hardware gleaming |
| **H1-B** | Flat lay on white card or linen, slight angle | Clean, editorial feel — whole bag from slightly above |
| **H1-C** | Extreme close-up of the clasp / gold hardware | Texture and quality detail — this is what justifies €80+ |

> H1-A is the lead Etsy photo. Everything depends on this shot looking premium.

## H2 — AirPod Holder

| Shot | Setup | What to show |
|---|---|---|
| **H2-A** | Open bag flat, AirPods Pro case sitting inside | Interior capacity — buyer needs to see it fits |
| **H2-B** | Bag clipped onto a bag strap or belt loop, closed | Shows the carry format |
| **H2-C** | Bag next to AirPods Pro case, both on white surface | Size reference — buyers always ask "how big is it?" |

---

## H3 — Amalfi Location

| Shot | Setup | What to show |
|---|---|---|
| **H3-A** | Bag held in front of anything coastal — water, terrace, coloured buildings | Context and aspiration. Shoot outside if possible |
| **H3-B** | Bag beside a lemon, a small ceramic, or a local prop on a table | Place association without needing custom graphics |
| **H3-C** | Bag on a white surface near a window with strong Mediterranean light | Clean hero fallback |

---

## Perception Test

After the shoot, pick the best H1-A photo. Show it unlabelled to **5 people who haven't seen the product** — a guest, colleague, anyone nearby. Ask only:

> *"What do you think this is, and what would you expect to pay for it?"*

**Pass:** ≥3 out of 5 say €80 or more unprompted → proceed to TASK-07 and TASK-08.
**Fail:** fewer than 3 → reshoot H1-A with better light or background before proceeding.

Record the result below.
