# Operator Evidence — HBAG (DISCOVERY-05)

## A) Launch and Operational Context

| Field | Value | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Launch surface | pre-website | confirmed |
| Execution posture | Speed-to-first-sales. Solo operator (Pete). Max 1–2 active channel experiments simultaneously. Etsy + Instagram/TikTok are first-day channels — no app or own-site required at launch. | confirmed |
| Primary time constraint | Tourist season window for in-destination (Brikette hostel + Positano boutiques) opens June 2026 — boutique outreach required by May. Etsy + social probe can begin as soon as stock is available. | confirmed |
| Hard stop conditions | Do not proceed to Etsy listing until TASK-06 perception test passes (≥3/5 cold reviewers estimate ≥€80 for H1 lead photo). Do not proceed to H5 (children's first bag) without GPSR + REACH compliance. | confirmed |

## B) Inventory and Product Readiness

| Field | Value | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Product 1 stock status | Not yet purchased — supplier quote (TASK-02) pending | confirmed |
| In-stock date (target) | TBD — depends on TASK-02 supplier quote and MOQ decision | pending |
| Sellable units (launch) | TBD — depends on MOQ from China supplier | pending |
| Compatibility matrix | Partial — AirPods Pro and AirPods 4 fit confirmed (TASK-03 complete 2026-02-17); attachment hardware functional | confirmed |
| Known sourcing constraints | Supplier is China-based. Unit cost, MOQ, and China→EU shipping cost all unknown. Amalfi custom graphics capability (H3 location variant) not yet confirmed with supplier. CE marking not required for H1–H4 fashion accessory variants (TASK-04 complete 2026-02-18). H5 children's first bag requires GPSR + REACH compliance (~€1,000–3,000) before launch — deferred. | confirmed |

## C) Commercial Architecture

| Field | Value | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Pricing model | Single unit | confirmed |
| Indicative price range | €80–€150 premium tier — Pete confirmed 2026-02-17 | confirmed |
| Payment provider (launch market) | Etsy Payments (primary); Stripe or equivalent for Instagram/TikTok DM-to-buy flow | pending |
| Returns policy | TBD — to be defined before first listing goes live | pending |

## D) Channel Pre-Decisions

| Decision | Value | Decision ref |
|---|---|---|
| Primary DTC channel | Etsy — pre-website, no infrastructure required, artisan buyer intent confirmed | DEC-HBAG-CH-01 |
| Discovery and demand probe | Instagram + TikTok — "DM to buy" CTA model; no dedicated social accounts confirmed yet | DEC-HBAG-CH-02 |
| Seasonal in-destination channel | Brikette hostel reception + 1 Positano boutique consignment (H3 location variant, June–September only) | DEC-HBAG-CH-03 |
| Channels ruled out at this stage | Own website (deferred post-checkpoint); H4 dog variant (deferred post-checkpoint); H5 children's variant (compliance block) | DEC-HBAG-CH-04 |

## E) Open Evidence Gaps

| Gap | Why needed | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Unit cost per bag (€) from China supplier | Required for margin stack and pricing floor confirmation; contribution margin target ≥35% cannot be confirmed without this | critical |
| Minimum order quantity (MOQ) | Required for inventory planning and cash commitment assessment | critical |
| China→EU shipping cost per unit at MOQ | Required for full contribution margin at target retail price | critical |
| In-stock date | Required for launch timeline; blocks Etsy listing and demand probe planning | high |
| Sellable units at launch | Required for inventory planning; blocks channel capacity decisions | high |
| Payment provider for Instagram/TikTok DM-to-buy flow | Required before TASK-07 social probe goes live | high |
| Returns policy (SLA and cost bearer) | Required before first listing; customer expectation management | high |
| Instagram/TikTok account status | Confirm whether separate HBAG account needed or shared with Brikette; required before social probe | high |
| Etsy shop status | Confirm whether HBAG Etsy shop already exists or must be created | high |
| Amalfi custom graphics capability (supplier) | Required to confirm H3 (location variant) is producible before in-destination launch | medium |
