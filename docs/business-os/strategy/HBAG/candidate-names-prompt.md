## Research Prompt

### 1. Role and Method

You are a product naming researcher. Your task is to produce a research-grounded naming framework — not a list of invented names, but an evidence-based evaluation of naming territories and candidate directions.

For every factual claim, competitor reference, domain or trademark check, and market statistic: cite your source. Separate clearly: (a) what was checked, (b) what was inferred, (c) what remains unknown without legal counsel. State the current date on any time-sensitive findings (domain availability, trademark status).

### 2. Business Context

**Product:** A high-quality Birkin-style mini handbag (structured body, gold hardware, leather-look exterior, multi-colour options) repositioned as a premium bag accessory. Two primary product uses:
1. **Bag charm** — worn as a decorative accessory on a larger handbag strap (via gold clasp)
2. **AirPod Pro holder** — worn as a functional tech accessory with internal fit for AirPods Pro, designed to clip onto a handbag

Both are the same physical product, sold with different messaging. A third use — **Amalfi Coast destination souvenir** — is a seasonal, location-specific channel variant of the same product.

**Positioning:** Premium artisan, Italian-origin story, €89–€149 price range. Not luxury-house (€300+) and not fast fashion (€5–€35). The buyer is a woman owning bags at the LV/Gucci entry tier (~€600+) who wants something that "reads real" in hand and in photos, made with visible skill, not printed in China. Craft and materiality are the story.

**ICP (primary):** Women ~27–42, fashion-aware, LV/Gucci-tier bag ownership, motivated by personal expression ("make it mine"), craft appreciation, and playful self-expression against a serious investment bag. Purchase deliberation: 3–7 days online.

**ICP (secondary):** International Amalfi Coast tourists with high daily spend ($391–$1,098/person/day) and a 1–3 day purchase window seeking a wearable, place-specific premium souvenir.

**Launch geography:** Italy (in-destination retail, Positano/Amalfi Coast), EU DTC (own website + Etsy), international DTC (primarily English-speaking markets). The brand will be experienced in Italian physical contexts AND in English-language digital discovery contexts (Instagram, TikTok, Etsy). The name must work in both.

**Price range:** €89–€149 for core product. Potentially a €149–€169 premium tier after brand trust is established.

**Emotional territory (5 descriptors):** Artisan, Place-rooted, Considered, Elevated-playful, Uncompromised.

**Growth intent:** The brand may extend to other artisan leather accessories (small leather goods, pouches, seasonal capsule drops) beyond the initial mini bag / charm. The name should not be tied to a specific product form or function.

**Market size note:** Do not assume market size figures — verify, cite, and date any figures presented. The artisan bag accessories / bag charm category is growing rapidly but published size figures vary widely; cite sources and their methodology. **Important:** "artisan bag accessories" is not a standardised publisher category — any single "market size" figure will reflect a broader scope (leather goods, fashion accessories, jewellery). Do not aggregate incompatible figures from different publishers; instead triangulate from: (a) adjacent market sizes with clearly stated methodology, (b) category momentum signals (wholesale platform data, editorial coverage, search trend data), and (c) in-market spend evidence (comparable brand revenue, platform CAC benchmarks). Note the methodology and scope of every figure cited.

### 3. Current Working Name

**Working name:** HBAG (internal code only — not a brand name, not a consumer-facing identity).

**Weaknesses:** "HBAG" is purely functional and descriptive ("H" + "bag" — reads as shorthand for "handbag"). It has no emotional resonance, no story, and no Italian or artisan connotation. As a brand name it would be generic, weak for trademark purposes (descriptive of the product category), and confusable with countless other bag-related identifiers. It imposes no constraints on naming direction — treat it as blank.

---

### 4. Naming Criteria

**Required criteria (all must be present in any shortlisted direction):**
- Pronounceable in both English and Italian without awkwardness
- No implication of luxury-house affiliation (no reference to Hermès, Chanel, Birkin, Louis Vuitton, or their trademark vocabulary)
- No generic "Italian leather" trope (e.g., "Pelletteria [surname]" without a real person behind it) — the Italian origin must be specific and earned, not generic
- Extensible beyond the bag charm / AirPod holder — the name should work for a broader leather goods brand
- Distinctiveness within the premium artisan accessories category — not easily confused with existing brands
- Plausible ownability: preliminary domain (.com, .eu, .it) and trademark check in Nice Class 18 (leather goods/bags), Class 14 (jewellery/accessories), and Class 25 (clothing/headwear — fashion accessory brands often register here) as a minimum
- Warm human tone — not clinical, not corporate, not generic luxury

**Desirable criteria:**
- Evokes place (Italian Coast, Amalfi/Positano context) without being geographically trapping
- Works visually as a wordmark (short, typographically interesting)
- Has a story the maker can tell in 10 seconds in a boutique setting
- Maps to the 2026 style direction: craft/material authenticity, vintage-inspired, no logos, texture

---

### 5. Anti-Criteria (Hard Constraints)

- **No luxury-house trademark adjacency** — any name that phonetically or visually suggests Hermès, Birkin, Kelly, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada, or their product names is out. The product is inspired by Birkin-style aesthetics but must not reference this in name.
- **No generic Italian-place names without operator connection** — "Roma," "Milano," "Toscana" etc. are generic and crowded. Positano/Amalfi connection is real and usable, but the name should not be a place name alone.
- **No English-language charm/tiny/mini tropes** — "Tiny," "Petit," "Mini," "Charm" as standalone brand names are descriptive, weak for trademark purposes, and already crowded in artisan accessories.
- **No clinical or functional naming** — nothing that sounds like a product description rather than a brand.
- **Cross-language connotation risk** — flag any name that has an unintended meaning in Italian, French, German, or Spanish. All four are relevant EU markets.

### 6. Competitive Naming Landscape

**Direct competitors (verified brands in the €50–€250 bag charm / AirPod holder / leather accessory space):**

| Brand | Name territory | Tone | Notes |
|-------|---------------|------|-------|
| Polène | French surname + Paris (Polène = mythological allusion) | Minimal, intellectual | Strong DTC brand; 3M IG followers |
| Maison de Sabré | "House of Sabré" — French maison + Spanish surname | Fashion-house formality | Australian brand mimicking French prestige |
| Cala Jade | Cala (Spanish: cove/inlet) + Jade (gemstone) | Nature/place | Norwegian brand; woven leather |
| Anya Hindmarch | Eponymous — British designer surname | Playful British | UK heritage; pop-culture charms |
| CH Carolina Herrera | Initials + designer surname | Fashion-house | Corporate; monogram-driven |
| Min & Mon | Portmanteau (minimal/minimal or given name) | Playful artisan | Colombian; handmade |
| KILLSPENCER | Compound/invented (Kill + Spencer) | Urban artisan | US tech-leather |
| Cuyana | Quechua word meaning "to love/cherish" | Warm, feminine | US brand; claimed to mean "love" in Quechua |

**Naming territory map:**
- **Crowded:** French maison formats (Maison de X, Atelier X), eponymous designer surnames, place-name + colour combinations
- **Open:** Short invented words with Italian phonetics, place-specific but not geographically generic Italian references, craft-technique-derived names (referencing a specific leather method), paired words with emotional resonance

**Manufacturer official accessory naming (separate comparator class):**

The dominant luxury houses name their bag accessories under the parent brand — the accessory name serves a product/motif function, not a standalone brand function. This creates a distinctive functional naming register that all artisan brands must position around:

| House | Accessory naming convention | Register |
|-------|----------------------------|---------|
| Hermès | "Bag Charm," "Petit Sac Attaché," "Cheval Surprise" | Parent brand + functional descriptor or motif name |
| Louis Vuitton | "Bag Charm," "Vivienne" (house character), "Monogram [motif]" | Parent brand + character/motif |
| Gucci | "Horsebit bag charm," "Interlocking G charm" | Parent brand + hardware motif + category |
| Chanel | "Camellia," "CC charm" | Parent brand + iconic symbol |
| CH Carolina Herrera | Dedicated AirPod charm line, named under parent house | House name + category |

**Implication for naming:** "Bag charm" and "AirPod holder" are firmly in the functional descriptor register — a standalone artisan brand must occupy entirely different naming territory. The name cannot be a functional descriptor, a house acronym, or anything that reads as an unofficial product name of the luxury houses above. This also creates confusion risks: a name similar to "Vivienne," "Camellia," or Hermès motif names would conflict both in consumer perception and potentially in trademark terms.

### 7. Research Tracks

**Track 1 — Naming convention analysis**
Map the dominant patterns in the premium artisan accessories naming space. What territories are over-used (French maison, eponymous, generic Italian)? What naming conventions appear unused? What does the Polène naming success (mythological allusion + French surname) suggest about what works? Cite specific examples.

**Track 2 — Naming territory exploration**

Explore five territories:

**A: Place-rooted, non-trapping** — Names that evoke a specific Italian place or landscape quality without being a place-name-only brand. Examples: reference to light quality, coastline terminology, specific Italian cultural vocabulary. Strategic logic: connects to operator's Positano location; evokes aspirational travel/destination; does not trap the brand to one location.

**B: Craft/material language** — Names derived from Italian leather craft terminology, tanning processes, or material qualities. Strategic logic: directly signals the craft-forward positioning; creates a story the maker can tell; unusual in the bag accessories space. Risk: may read technical rather than warm; requires a human voice to bring it alive.

**C: Invented / coined with Italian phonetics** — Short invented words (5–8 letters) with soft Italian vowel sounds, pronounceable in English and Italian. Strategic logic: highest distinctiveness; fully ownable; extensible. Risk: requires brand-building effort to create meaning; initially harder to explain.

**D: Emotion/quality as a single word** — Names from Italian or related romance languages that describe a quality the buyer feels (e.g., feeling of "unmistakably mine," quality that "reads real," the sensation of finding exactly the right thing). Strategic logic: emotional resonance; premium feel; story-worthy. Risk: may be too abstract; cross-language meaning check required.

**E: Paired words / compound** — Two-word constructions that pair a place or material quality with a human or emotional concept. Strategic logic: more descriptive than single invented word; easier to position. Risk: may be too literal; domain availability harder with two words.

For each territory, provide 3–5 name directions (illustrative, not final), the strategic logic, risks, distinctiveness spectrum placement (generic → descriptive → suggestive → arbitrary → coined), and expansion fit beyond the initial product.

**Track 3 — Launch-market suitability**
Assess top 10–15 name directions from Track 2 for:
- Phonetics in English and Italian
- Unintended meanings in Italian, French, German, Spanish (flag any risk)
- Accessibility to non-English speakers (the Etsy/Instagram international buyer)
- Visual/typographic workability as a wordmark

**Track 4 — Domain and trademark risk flags**
For top 10–15 directions:
- Domain: Is .com taken? Is .eu or .it available? Confusion risk level (low/medium/high). Date your check.
- Trademarks: Obvious conflicts in Nice Class 18 (leather goods/bags), Class 14 (jewellery/accessories), and Class 25 (clothing/headwear — fashion accessory brands often register here). EU trademark descriptiveness risk. Note confidence: checked vs. inferred vs. unknown without counsel.
- Separate domain availability from trademark availability clearly.
- **TM search tools:** Use TMview (tmview.org), EUIPO eSearch, and/or WIPO Global Brand Database. If any tool returns an access error (e.g., 403 blocked), note this explicitly and use the remaining tools. Do not omit TM flags because a single tool was blocked. If all tools are inaccessible, label the entire TM column as "tooling blocked — inferred only." Definitive clearance requires legal counsel regardless of what research tools return.

**Track 5 — Expansion headroom**
Which naming territories allow the brand to expand to broader leather accessories (scarves, small leather goods, seasonal collections) without the name feeling wrong? Which trap the brand to a single product type?
