## Research Prompt

### 1. Role, Method, and the Core Problem

You are a product naming researcher. Your task is to produce a research-grounded naming framework — not a list of invented names, but an evidence-based evaluation of naming territories and candidate directions.

For every factual claim, competitor reference, domain or trademark check, and market statistic: cite your source. Separate clearly: (a) what was checked, (b) what was inferred, (c) what remains unknown without legal counsel. State the current date on any time-sensitive findings (domain availability, trademark status).

#### The domain exhaustion problem — read before generating any names

Three naming rounds have now been run for this brand. Combined total: **80 candidate names generated, 80 .com domains taken (100% failure rate).** This is not bad luck. It is a structural problem:

**Short pronounceable coinages (5–8 letters) with Italian or Romance-language phonotactics are almost entirely exhausted in the .com namespace.** Domain investment funds systematically register every plausible 5–8 letter token with open vowels, soft consonants, and feminine suffixes (-a, -ella, -ina, -eva, -ora, -elo, -eri) across all common Romance-language patterns. These are held speculatively and will either redirect to a broker page or show "make an offer" pricing in the four-figure range. Standard registration price (~€10–15/yr) is not achievable for names in this phonetic class.

**Operational implication for this run:** you must change the generation strategy, not just the names. Generating more names of the same structural type will produce the same result. The methodology described in §8 requires you to work within structural patterns that have materially lower squatter density. Read §5.3 before beginning Track 2.

### 2. Business Context

**Product:** A high-quality Birkin-style mini handbag (structured body, gold hardware, leather-look exterior, multi-colour options) repositioned as a premium bag accessory. Two primary product uses:
1. **Bag charm** — worn as a decorative accessory on a larger handbag strap (via gold clasp)
2. **AirPod Pro holder** — worn as a functional tech accessory with internal fit for AirPods Pro, designed to clip onto a handbag

Both are the same physical product, sold with different messaging. A third use — **Amalfi Coast destination souvenir** — is a seasonal, location-specific channel variant of the same product.

**Positioning:** Premium artisan, Italian-origin story, €89–€149 price range. Not luxury-house (€300+) and not fast fashion (€5–€35). The buyer is a woman owning bags at the LV/Gucci entry tier (~€600+) who wants something that "reads real" in hand and in photos, made with visible skill, not printed in China. Craft and materiality are the story.

**ICP (primary):** Women ~27–42, fashion-aware, LV/Gucci-tier bag ownership, motivated by personal expression ("make it mine"), craft appreciation, and playful self-expression against a serious investment bag. Purchase deliberation: 3–7 days online.

**ICP (secondary):** International Amalfi Coast tourists with high daily spend ($391–$1,098/person/day) and a 1–3 day purchase window seeking a wearable, place-specific premium souvenir.

**Launch geography:** Italy (in-destination retail, Positano/Amalfi Coast), EU DTC (own website + Etsy), international DTC (primarily English-speaking markets). The brand will be experienced in Italian physical contexts AND in English-language digital discovery contexts (Instagram, TikTok, Etsy). The name must work in both.

**Price range:** €89–€149 for core product. Potentially a €149–€169 premium tier after brand trust is established.

**Emotional territory (5 descriptors):** Artisan, Place-rooted, Considered, Elevated-playful, Uncompromised.

**Growth intent:** The brand may extend to other artisan leather accessories (small leather goods, pouches, seasonal capsule drops). The name should not be tied to a specific product form or function.

**Market size note:** Do not assume market size figures — verify, cite, and date any figures presented. Triangulate from: (a) adjacent market sizes with clearly stated methodology, (b) category momentum signals (wholesale platform data, editorial coverage, search trend data), and (c) in-market spend evidence (comparable brand revenue, platform CAC benchmarks). Note scope and methodology of every figure cited.

---

### 3. Current Working Name

**Working name:** HBAG (internal code only — not a brand name, not a consumer-facing identity). Treat as blank.

---

### 4. Naming Criteria

**Required (all must be present in any shortlisted direction):**
- Pronounceable in both English and Italian without awkwardness
- No implication of luxury-house affiliation (no reference to Hermès, Chanel, Birkin, Louis Vuitton, or their trademark vocabulary)
- No generic "Italian leather" trope without earned specificity
- Extensible beyond the bag charm / AirPod holder to a broader leather goods brand
- Distinctive within the premium artisan accessories category
- .com domain available at standard registration price — see §5 for verification protocol
- Warm human tone — not clinical, not corporate, not generic luxury

**Length guidance (informed by domain exhaustion — see §1):**
- **Prefer 9–12 letter tokens.** Squatter density drops significantly above 8 letters.
- **6–8 letter tokens are permitted only if** the structural pattern is non-standard (see §5.3) and .com availability is confirmed before shortlisting.
- Do not propose 5-letter coinages — these are almost universally registered.

**Desirable:**
- Evokes place (Italian Coast, Amalfi/Positano) without geographic trapping
- Works visually as a wordmark
- Has a 10-second boutique story the maker can tell
- Maps to 2026 style direction: craft/material authenticity, vintage-inspired, no logos, texture

### 5. Hard Blockers, Domain Protocol, and Eliminated Names

#### 5.1 Domain availability is a hard blocker

**.com availability at standard registration price is a prerequisite for shortlisting.** A name may not appear in the final shortlist without verified .com availability.

**Verification protocol — apply to every candidate before including in any output:**

1. Use the Verisign RDAP endpoint: `https://rdap.verisign.com/com/v1/domain/<name>.com`
   - HTTP 404 response = domain unregistered → proceed to step 2
   - HTTP 200 response = domain registered → **eliminate immediately, do not shortlist**
2. For any name passing step 1, confirm with a registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, or equivalent):
   - "Available — register for €X/yr" → **eligible to shortlist**
   - "This domain is for sale — make an offer" or broker pricing → **eliminate** (treat as unavailable)
3. Document for every candidate: RDAP result, registrar result, date checked.

Note: .eu and .it are desirable but secondary. .com is the only hard gate.

#### 5.2 Eliminated names (do not re-propose — 80 names across 3 rounds)

All of the following have been checked and eliminated. Do not reuse, vary phonetically, or use as roots for new proposals without re-verifying .com availability of the new token.

#### 5.3 Required generation strategies for this round

Because the standard coinage space is exhausted, you must use one or more of the following structural patterns. **Only use patterns from this list for new candidates.** For each candidate you generate, state which pattern was used.

**Pattern A — Extended coinages (9–12 letters)**
Longer tokens have significantly lower speculative-registration density. Combine two Italian morphemes (neither of which is a standalone common dictionary word) into a 9–12 letter token. The combination should feel natural to say, not concatenated.
Examples of morpheme pairs to explore (do not take these literally — use as structural models): `vella+cino`, `mera+sona`, `porta+vile`, `luce+varo`.
Constraint: the resulting name must not sound Germanic, Slavic, or clinical.

**Pattern B — Phonetic respelling of an Italian quality concept**
Take an Italian word or phrase encoding a brand-relevant quality (touch, lustre, finish, warmth, curve, edge) and systematically respell it — transpose a vowel, double a consonant, alter the ending — to create a token that sounds like the source word without being identical. The source word must not be a trademark, luxury house reference, or purely descriptive term.
Check the respelled version via RDAP before including. Document the source word and respelling rule used.

**Pattern C — Non-obvious root blend**
Combine two Italian word fragments where neither fragment is a common standalone word in Italian. The goal is a token with Italian phonotactics and emotional resonance that does not trigger recognition of a source word in either language. This avoids both dictionary-word TM risk and the phonetic patterns most heavily squatted (which tend to be transparent diminutives of common Italian nouns).

**Pattern D — Masterbrand + functional suffix compound**
Generate a shorter coined root (6–8 letters) and check availability of `<root>.com` first. If taken, test `<root>co.com`, `<root>studio.com`, `<root>atelier.com` as the brand domain — the brand identity becomes the compound (e.g., "Veloriaco" or "Lurena Studio") with the short form as the spoken name. This is a legitimate brand architecture: many fashion brands use `<name>co.com` or `<name>studio.com` as their primary domain. The domain that must be available is the compound.
Note: if using this pattern, the recommended output should clearly distinguish the spoken/wordmark name from the domain string.

**Pattern E — Anchor in an obscure but real Italian craft or place word**
Rather than coining from scratch, find a real Italian word from a niche domain (artisan craft vocabulary, regional dialect, technical textile or leather term, coastal geography of the Amalfi area) that: (a) is not commonly known or already used as a brand, (b) is not descriptive of leather goods or bag accessories specifically, (c) passes a basic TM search for Classes 18/14/25, and (d) has .com available. This is the "Polène approach" — an obscure word with a good story. Document the source, meaning, and why it is non-descriptive for leather goods purposes.

---

### 6. Anti-Criteria (Hard Constraints)

- **No luxury-house trademark adjacency** — no phonetic or visual suggestion of Hermès, Birkin, Kelly, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada, or their product names.
- **No generic Italian-place names without operator connection** — "Roma," "Milano," "Toscana" etc. are crowded and weak for trademark. Positano/Amalfi connection is real but the name should not be a standalone place name.
- **No English-language charm/tiny/mini tropes** — "Tiny," "Petit," "Mini," "Charm" as standalone brands are descriptive and crowded.
- **No clinical or functional naming** — nothing that sounds like a product description rather than a brand.
- **Cross-language connotation risk** — flag any name with an unintended meaning in Italian, French, German, or Spanish.
- **No 5-letter coinages** — domain squatter density is near 100% for 5-letter pronounceable tokens.
- **No .com domain parked for sale at a premium** — treat as unavailable.

---

### 7. Competitive Naming Landscape

**Direct competitors (verified brands in the €50–€250 bag charm / AirPod holder / leather accessory space):**

| Brand | Name territory | Tone | Notes |
|-------|---------------|------|-------|
| Polène | French surname + mythological allusion | Minimal, intellectual | Strong DTC; 3M IG followers — proof that invented/obscure names work |
| Maison de Sabré | House-of format + Spanish surname | Fashion-house formality | Australian brand mimicking French prestige |
| Cala Jade | Place (cove) + gemstone | Nature/place | Norwegian brand; woven leather |
| Anya Hindmarch | Eponymous British designer | Playful British | Pop-culture charms |
| Min & Mon | Portmanteau | Playful artisan | Colombian; handmade |
| Cuyana | Quechua word "to love/cherish" | Warm, feminine | Proof that a non-Romance word with Italian-adjacent phonetics works at scale |

**Naming territory map:**
- **Crowded/exhausted:** French maison formats, eponymous surnames, 5–8 letter Italian-phonetic coinages (.com namespace saturated)
- **Open:** Extended coinages (9–12 letters), obscure real Italian words with clean TM/domain, compound brand domains (`<name>co.com`)

**Manufacturer accessory naming (separate comparator class — avoid this register):**

| House | Convention |
|-------|-----------|
| Hermès | Parent brand + functional descriptor or motif name |
| Louis Vuitton | Parent brand + house character |
| Gucci | Parent brand + hardware motif + category |
| Chanel | Parent brand + iconic symbol |

The name must not read as a functional descriptor, house acronym, or unofficial luxury-product reference.

### 8. Research Tracks

**Before starting Track 2: run a baseline domain-pressure test.**
Generate 5 names using the standard short-coinage approach (5–8 letter Italian-phonetic tokens) and verify them via RDAP. If all 5 are taken (as expected from prior rounds), document this and proceed exclusively with the patterns in §5.3. This step exists to demonstrate to the output reader that the problem is structural, not random.

---

**Track 1 — Naming convention analysis**
Map dominant patterns in the premium artisan accessories naming space. What territories are over-used? What is unused? What does Polène's success (mythological allusion + French surname, fully invented, built from zero) suggest? Cite specific examples.

---

**Track 2 — Naming territory exploration**

Explore five territories. For each, generate candidates using the structural patterns in §5.3. Apply the RDAP domain check to every candidate before including it. For each candidate: state the pattern used, RDAP result, registrar check, and date. Mark eliminated candidates as struck-through with reason.

Generate at minimum: 6 candidates per territory using §5.3 patterns, pre-domain-filtered to return ≥2 viable survivors per territory. If a territory consistently fails domain checks, document this and shift generation to §5.3 Pattern D or E.

**A: Place-rooted, non-trapping** — Names evoking a specific Italian place or landscape quality without being a literal place name. Explore light quality, coastline texture, specific Amalfi cultural vocabulary. Use §5.3 Pattern B or E primarily.

**B: Craft/material language** — Names from Italian leather craft terminology or material qualities, humanised and warmed. Use §5.3 Pattern B or E primarily. Flag EU trademark descriptiveness risk for any name derived from a process term.

**C: Extended coined with Italian phonetics** — Invented tokens, 9–12 letters, soft Italian vowel sounds, pronounceable in both languages. Use §5.3 Pattern A or C exclusively. Do not generate 5–8 letter standard coinages for this territory.

**D: Emotion/quality as a single word** — Italian or Romance-language quality words (touch, lustre, finish, warmth) respelled or blended. Use §5.3 Pattern B or C. Flag cross-language meaning risks.

**E: Compound / masterbrand + suffix domain** — Either a two-morpheme compound or a shorter coined root with a compound domain strategy (`<root>co.com`, `<root>studio.com`). Use §5.3 Pattern D. Clearly distinguish spoken name from domain string in output.

---

**Track 3 — Launch-market suitability**
For top 10–15 domain-cleared names from Track 2:
- Phonetics in English and Italian
- Unintended meanings in Italian, French, German, Spanish
- Accessibility to non-English speakers (Etsy/Instagram international buyer)
- Visual/typographic workability as a wordmark

**Track 4 — Domain and trademark risk flags**
For every name reaching Track 3:
- **Domain:** State RDAP result + registrar confirmation + date. Format: "available — RDAP 404 + Namecheap standard price, verified [date]" or "eliminated."
- **Trademarks:** Obvious conflicts in Nice Classes 18, 14, 25. EU trademark descriptiveness risk. Confidence level: checked / inferred / unknown without counsel.
- **TM search tools:** Use TMview (tmview.org), EUIPO eSearch, and/or WIPO Global Brand Database. If any tool returns a 403 or access error, note this explicitly and use remaining tools. If all are inaccessible, label the TM column "tooling blocked — inferred only." Definitive clearance requires legal counsel regardless.

**Track 5 — Expansion headroom**
Which territories allow extension to broader leather accessories (scarves, SLGs, seasonal collections) without the name feeling wrong? Which trap the brand?
