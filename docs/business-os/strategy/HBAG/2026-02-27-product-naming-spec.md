# Product Naming Spec — Caryina / HBAG (Round 1)

Agent instruction: read every section of this spec before generating a single name. Generate exactly 75 names. Follow §6 output format without deviation. Do not reuse any name from §5.3.

---

## §1. Brand-Product Name Relationship

**Business name:** Caryina

**Expansion-headroom rationale:** Caryina is a coined Italian-register proper noun derived from "carino/carina" (cute/lovely in Italian) via an operator-invented orthographic twist (`Car` + `y` + `ina`). It is not product-specific — it does not say "bag", "charm", or "accessory". It works as a masterbrand for any fashion accessory line, which is why the naming pipeline scored it 25/25 in Round 3.

**Compound pattern chosen:** `Caryina [Line Name]`

All product lines are marketed as "Caryina [Line Name]" across PDPs, packaging, Etsy listings, and social captions. The Line Name identifies the product variant or product line; Caryina carries the brand equity and the Italian-register warmth. Future SKUs (AirPod holder variant, Amalfi location edition, dog poop bag holder) each get their own Line Name under the same compound pattern.

**Naming convention for future SKUs:**

| SKU | Full Name | Line Name rationale |
|-----|-----------|---------------------|
| Hero mini bag (bag charm) | Caryina [Line Name] | This spec |
| AirPod / small items holder | Caryina [Line Name variant] | Second naming exercise — same compound, different Line Name |
| Amalfi destination edition | Caryina Positano | "Positano" is the place name; instantly legible as a destination product |
| Dog poop bag holder (if launched) | Caryina [Line Name] | Third naming exercise at launch |

## §2. Product Context

**Hero product:** Structured Birkin-style mini handbag — gold hardware, multi-colour leather-look exterior, structured body. The same physical product is positioned as a bag charm that clips onto a larger handbag (LV, Gucci, Chanel, Prada) via its hardware, worn as a daily detail rather than a statement piece.

**Product category:** Fashion accessories — specifically, bag accessories / bag charms / mini bags. Not jewellery (no precious metals or stones). Not clothing. Not a "toy" or children's product.

**Price point:** €80–€150 at launch. Perceived quality tier: premium craft, not high-street.

**Quality register:** Structured body. Clean edge finishing. One gold-tone hardware element. Reads premium in hand and in photos. "Designed in Italy" is the defensible origin claim. Manufacturing is China-based.

**ICP — Primary:** Women ~27–42, fashion-aware, who own one or more bags at LV/Gucci entry tier (€600–€1,500+). They want personal expression through a bag accessory that reads as genuinely crafted, not mass-produced. They deliberate 3–7 days before purchasing at this tier. Discovery via TikTok/Instagram; conversion via Etsy or Caryina website.

**ICP — Secondary:** Gift buyers (mostly men) purchasing for women in the primary ICP — birthdays, Christmas, milestone self-treats. Packaging and brand story do significant work in this use case.

**Distribution channels and naming constraints:**
- **Etsy:** 140-character listing title limit. "Caryina [Line Name]" must leave room for descriptive keywords in the title. Line Name should be ≤ 12 characters.
- **Instagram / TikTok:** Line Name must work as a hashtag and in short caption copy. No spaces, no punctuation.
- **Caryina website (DTC):** No character constraints. Line Name serves as page heading.

**Competitive set to avoid confusion with:** Polène, DeMellier, Strathberry, Cuyana, Mejuri, Monica Vinader, Aesop, The Row. No name should be phonetically close to any of these.

## §3. DWPEIC Scoring Rubric

Six dimensions. Composite max: 30.

### D — Distinctiveness (1–5)
- **5:** Fully coined or highly obscure; no phonetic cousin in the fashion accessories space; strong TM ownability
- **4:** Coined or rare real word; low competitor confusion risk
- **3:** Somewhat unique but shares phonetic territory with known fashion terms or common Italian words
- **2:** Sounds like something already common in fashion accessories; weak TM position
- **1:** Directly confused with a competitor, a luxury brand name, or a generic product descriptor

### W — Wordmark quality (1–5)
- **5:** 5–12 characters; strong visual rhythm; no awkward letter pairs; works in "Caryina [Name]" compound without visual clash; readable as an Etsy listing title
- **4:** Solid wordmark with minor reservations in compound
- **3:** Functional but forgettable; no standout visual quality
- **2:** Too long (>12 chars for a Line Name), hard to read in compound, or visually cluttered
- **1:** Does not work as part of the "Caryina [Name]" compound wordmark

### P — Phonetic quality (1–5)
- **5:** Flows naturally in Italian and English; soft open vowels; 2–4 syllables; immediately memorable; sounds right coming out of the mouth of a 35-year-old Italian or English woman saying "my Caryina [Name]"
- **4:** Mostly smooth; minor awkwardness in one language
- **3:** Pronounceable but no standout quality; forgettable aurally
- **2:** Awkward in Italian or English; requires instruction
- **1:** Genuinely difficult or unpleasant to say in either language

### E — Expansion headroom (1–5)
- **5:** Works as a Line Name for any fashion accessory in the Caryina range (bag charm, AirPod holder, small pouch, keyring) — not trapped to "mini bag" specifically
- **4:** Strong headroom with minor pull toward mini bag / charm category
- **3:** Works broadly but feels slightly product-specific to mini bags
- **2:** Only works for the hero mini bag; would feel wrong on adjacent accessories
- **1:** Trapped to a specific product form or use case

### I — ICP resonance (1–5)
*Scroll-stop test: Would a 32-year-old woman in Milan, carrying her Neverfull on a Friday afternoon, stop scrolling Instagram Reels at the name "Caryina [Line Name]" — displayed as a product caption with a clean editorial photo of the structured mini bag — and tap through to a €120 PDP?*

- **5:** Immediately feels like a name she'd use — warm, Italian-adjacent, slightly aspirational but not cold; she could imagine gifting it or saying "I bought the Caryina [Name]" to a friend
- **4:** Appealing and on-tone for the category; feels premium fashion
- **3:** Neutral; neither repels nor attracts specifically
- **2:** Too clinical, too generic, or too niche to connect — she scrolls past
- **1:** Actively wrong for the ICP — sounds mass-market, medical, or culturally tone-deaf

### C — Category signal (1–5)
*Etsy legibility test: On an Etsy listing page titled "Caryina [Line Name] — Mini Bag Charm", does the Line Name help a new buyer understand this is a premium structured bag accessory, even before they read the description?*

- **5:** The Line Name itself immediately implies "bag", "charm", "accessory", or "fashion detail" through vocabulary origin, sound, or obvious semantic territory — the buyer knows what they're looking at before reading further
- **4:** Strong category signal; a fashion-aware buyer would connect it quickly
- **3:** Neutral; the buyer relies entirely on the rest of the listing title for category signal
- **2:** Slightly misleading — might imply a different product category
- **1:** Actively wrong category signal — implies jewellery, clothing, homeware, or nothing fashion-adjacent

### Composite score
Sum D + W + P + E + I + C. Maximum 30.
- ≥ 24: high-priority for TM pre-screen and operator review
- 18–23: secondary
- ≤ 17: included but low priority

## §4. Naming Territories and Morpheme Pools

Five territories. Target: 15 names per territory = 75 total.

---

### Territory 1 — Italian Form Vocabulary (15 names)

**Rationale:** The product is a structured mini bag with a specific physical form — compact, clasp-fastened, handled. Italian vocabulary for small structured containers and bag hardware gives Line Names that are genuinely legible in Italian fashion copy, signal the product form, and are distinct from generic English bag vocabulary. Category signal (C) will be high; Expansion headroom (E) may be moderate.

**Seed vocabulary (form and structure):**
- borsa (bag) → derivations: borsella, borsite, borsina, borsovale, borsura
- fibbia (clasp/buckle) → fibbiola, fibbina, fibbetta, fibbella
- fermaglio (clasp/brooch) → fermaglina, fermagella, fermovale
- teca (case/container) → tecella, tecovale, tecina
- custodia (holder/case) → custovale, custodina (too long), custella
- sella (saddle — refers to the saddle structure of structured bags) → sellina, sellovale, selletta
- linguetta (tongue/tab) → linguella, linguettina (too long)
- gancio (hook/clasp) → ganciola, gancella
- manico (handle) → manicella, manicola, manicova

**Generation instruction:** Coin Line Names from this vocabulary using diminutive and feminine Italian morphology. Aim for 6–10 characters. Do not use full dictionary words as Line Names — transform them. Example: borsa → Borsella. Target count: 15 names.

---

### Territory 2 — Italian Bijoux / Ornament Vocabulary (15 names)

**Rationale:** The product functions as jewellery for a handbag — a chosen ornamental detail that reads premium at close range. Italian bijoux, jewellery, and adornment vocabulary gives names with high ICP resonance (I) because this is the exact emotional register the primary buyer responds to. Names from this territory may have lower C (category signal) but higher I scores.

**Seed vocabulary (ornament and jewellery):**
- ciondolo (pendant/charm) → ciondola, ciondella, ciondovale
- pendente (pendant) → pendella, pendina, pendovale
- gioiello (jewel) → gioiella, gioiellina (too long), gioiova
- vezzo (charm/bead strand/string of jewels) → vezzola, vezzina, vezzetta, vezzovale
- monile (necklace/jewel — archaic, elegant) → monella (avoid — has negative connotation "little rascal"), monila, monilova, moniletta
- gemma (gem) → gemmella, gemmina, gemmova, gemmella
- brillante (brilliant/diamond) → brillantina (avoid — hairspray brand), brillovale, brillella
- filigrana (filigree) → filigrella, filigrina, filigova
- perla (pearl) → perlina, perlella, perlovale
- agata (agate stone) → agatella, agatina, agatova

**Generation instruction:** Coin Line Names from bijoux vocabulary. Avoid monile → Monella (Italian slang for "little rascal/naughty girl" — wrong register). Avoid brillante → Brillantina (hair product brand — TM conflict risk). Target: 15 names.

---

### Territory 3 — Italian Craft / Leather Vocabulary (15 names)

**Rationale:** The brand positions itself on genuine craft — "made to be shown", "considered detail", "finished by hand". Italian leather craft and artisan vocabulary gives names that are distinct, carry a genuine story, and are non-descriptive (important for TM). Names from this territory score high on D (distinctiveness) because they draw from niche craft lexicons that are not commonly used in fashion product naming.

**Seed vocabulary (craft and leather):**
- cuoio (tanned leather/hide) → cuoiella, cuoiova, cuoiina (too close to cuoio)
- conciatura (tanning process) → conciella, conciovale, conciura
- rifinitura (finishing process) → rifinella, rifinova, rifinovale
- patina (patina — surface finish) → patinella, patinova, patovale
- cesellatura (chasing/engraving craft) → cesellova, cesellella
- selleria (saddlery — the artisan trade) → selleria → sellerina, sellerova, sellerella
- intarsio (inlay craft) → intarsella, intarsova, intarsina
- borchiatura (studding craft) → borchiella, borchiva, borchina (3 syllables, clean)
- lucidatura (polishing) → lucidella, lucidova, lucidina
- pinzatura (stitching/clamping) → pinzella, pinzova, pinzina

**Generation instruction:** Draw from artisan craft vocabulary. The goal is names that carry a craft story ("from cesellatura, the artisan finishing technique") without being descriptive of the product in TM terms. None of these words means "mini bag" — they describe the process of making things beautifully. Target: 15 names.

---

### Territory 4 — Coined Diminutives (15 names)

**Rationale:** Caryina itself is a coined diminutive — "carino/carina" + the y-insertion = warmth, playfulness, Italian register. Line Names that follow the same morphological pattern (warm Italian-adjacent roots + diminutive endings) will feel natural as part of "Caryina [Line Name]". These names will score high on I (ICP resonance) because they match the brand's own naming logic. The risk is lower C (category signal) — mitigated by strong wordmark quality.

**Seed roots (warm, positive, Italian):**
- cara (dear/beloved) → Carella, Carova, Carina (too close to Caryina — avoid)
- bella (beautiful) → Bellina, Bellovale, Bellova
- dolce (sweet) → Dolcina, Dolcella, Dolcova
- luce (light) → Lucella, Lucina, Lucova
- miele (honey) → Mielina, Mielella, Mielovale
- fiore (flower) → Fiorina, Fiorella, Fiorova
- morbida (soft) → Morbina, Morbella, Morbova
- velluto (velvet) → Vellina, Vellovale, Vellova
- tenera (tender) → Tenerina, Tenerella, Tenerova
- gaia (joyful/bright) → Gaiella, Gaiova, Gaiina

**Constraints:** Do not use "Carina" (too close to Caryina — phonetic confusion risk). Do not use names that are common Italian women's names (Lucia, Rosa, Elena, Sofia) — TM ownability is very low. Do not use "Dolcevita" or "Bellavita" — existing brand names. Target: 15 names.

---

### Territory 5 — International Editorial / Fashion Vocabulary (15 names)

**Rationale:** The distribution plan includes channels where English-speaking buyers are significant (Etsy global, Instagram international). The brand's English copy register is conversational and confident. Line Names from international fashion vocabulary — words that feel equally at home in English fashion copy and in Italian fashion contexts — can score high on both I (ICP resonance for English-speaking buyers) and C (category signal). Examples: Polène uses French words; Cuyana uses Quechua vocabulary. The goal here is words that are not Italian but feel European and fashion-adjacent.

**Seed vocabulary (international fashion register):**
- From French fashion vocabulary: nacre (mother-of-pearl), soie (silk), toile, noire, dorée (gilded), muse, lisse (smooth), satin
- From Portuguese/Spanish fashion vocabulary: seda (silk), dorada (gilded), prima (first/finest), nova, breve (brief/short)
- From Latin/classical vocabulary: forma, pura, prima, lumen, aura, sola, nota, viva
- From English fashion vocabulary that sounds non-English when spoken: edit, poise, cipher, grain, crest, lace, clasp (too generic)

**Constraints:** Do not use words already trademarked by fashion brands. "Toile" is used by many brands. "Muse" is used by many brands. "Noir" / "Noire" is heavily used. Favour words that are non-descriptive in TM terms. Target: 15 names.

---

## §5. Hard Blockers and Elimination List

### 5.1 Regulatory / legal hard blockers

- **"Birkin" in any form:** IP/trade dress risk — 2025 Paris Judicial Court ruling. No Line Name that contains, phonetically echoes, or visually resembles "Birkin". Hard block.
- **"Hermès" adjacency:** Any name that sounds like a derivative of Hermès (e.g., Ermella, Hermina) — confusion risk with a luxury TM holder. Hard block.
- **"Made in Italy" implicit:** No Line Name that includes or implies Italian manufacturing origin (e.g., "Milano" used in a way that implies manufacturing, "Artigianale" meaning handmade in Italy). Origin claim is "Designed in Italy" — not "Made in Italy". Soft constraint — avoid names that would create a misleading Italian manufacture implication.
- **CE / GPSR regulatory vocabulary:** No medical, safety, or regulatory register words. The product must not imply safety certification it does not hold.

### 5.2 Brand anti-patterns (from brand profile §E and §D)

- No "Luxury", "Premium", "Exclusive" in the Line Name — empty fashion filler
- No "Birkin", "Kelly", "Speedy" or any specific bag-model reference — trade dress risk
- No "Statement" — hype language incompatible with curated restraint positioning
- No "-ling" endings — sounds diminutive in a childish English way, not in an Italian way
- No script-font-heavy names (i.e., names with awkward capital letter pairings that would be unreadable in Cormorant Garamond italics)
- No names phonetically close to: Polène, DeMellier, Strathberry, Cuyana, Mejuri, Monica Vinader, Aesop (competitive confusion risk)
- No "Monella" — Italian slang for "little rascal" — wrong emotional register
- No "Brillantina" — hairspray brand (TM conflict risk)

### 5.3 Eliminated names from prior rounds

None — this is Round 1 for HBAG product naming.
