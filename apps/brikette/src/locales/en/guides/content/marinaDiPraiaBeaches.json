    "Marina di Praia is Praiano’s tucked-away pebble cove — a short bus ride from Hostel Brikette but far quieter than Positano’s headline beaches. Fishing boats, a historic watchtower, and stone walkways wrap the bay so you still have services without the crowds.",
    "Use this guide to ride the bus there and back confidently, understand how the lido works, and plan a relaxed dinner before heading home."

        "Unlike Spiaggia Grande or Fornillo, Marina di Praia sits in a narrow gorge just outside Praiano. The cliffs shelter the water from swells, fishing boats bob in the harbour, and the vibe stays low key even in August.",
        "It is an easy add-on to a Praiano day trip or a change of scenery mid-week. The smaller footprint means fewer loungers overall, but you trade that for calmer crowds and photogenic scenery for sunset."

        "From Hostel Brikette walk down Via Pasitea to the Sponda bus stop and catch the SITA bus heading towards Amalfi. Ask the driver for \"Marina di Praia\" so they know to stop — it is roughly 20 minutes from Positano depending on traffic.",
        "Hop off at the signed stop (between Praiano and Furore) and follow the stone path downhill for two minutes to the waterfront. The walk is paved the entire way. For the return journey, wait at the same stop on the opposite side; buses towards Positano usually run every 30–40 minutes in season but thin out after 20:30.",
        "Buy and validate your SITA tickets before boarding — the tobacconist near the Chiesa Nuova stop and the newsstand in Positano both stock them. Review the %LINK:sitaTickets|SITA bus guide% if you need a refresher on ticket types and late-night options."

Check the posted timetable when you arrive and aim for the second-to-last service in case one is full. After the final bus, taxis from Praiano to Positano cost €35–€45, so split with travel mates if you linger longer."
