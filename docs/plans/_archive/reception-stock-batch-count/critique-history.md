## Round 1 — 2026-02-28

### Issues Opened This Round

| ID | Severity | Target | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1-01 | Moderate | TASK-02 TC-02 | Exported API declares `{ progress, saveProgress, clearProgress }` but TC-02 referenced `restoreProgress call after save` — restore is automatic on mount, not a separate call. |
| 1-02 | Minor | TASK-06 TC-01 | Meta-TC reference ("All 11 TC cases from TASK-03 and TASK-04 pass") — count was cited but advisory only; no enumeration mismatch found that blocks execution. |
