  "intro": [
    "Fiordo di Furore is the Amalfi Coast’s postcard gorge — a narrow inlet beneath an arched bridge with emerald water and sheer cliffs. It is a small, mostly wild cove with no beach clubs or restaurants, so come prepared for a swim, a few photos, and dramatic cliff jumping.",
    "Use this guide to travel by bus, understand how limited the facilities are, and plan your exit so you are not stranded once the last SITA service fills up."

        "From Hostel Brikette walk down Via Pasitea to the Sponda stop and board a SITA bus towards Amalfi. Tell the driver you need \"Fiordo di Furore\" so they remember to pull over — the stop sits between Praiano and Furore and can be easy to miss on a busy day.",
        "After a 25-minute ride hop off at the marked stop just before the bridge. Follow the stairs carved into the cliff for a couple of minutes until you reach the shingle beach tucked beneath the arch."

        "There are no ticket offices or machines in the gorge. Buy a round-trip ticket in Positano (tabacchi near Chiesa Nuova or the Sponda newsstand) and validate it when you board.",
        "Summer buses can arrive already full after leaving Amalfi. Aim for an earlier departure than you think you need, and let fellow travellers at the stop know you are waiting so the driver keeps an eye out. If two buses pass without stopping, consider splitting a taxi from the road above."

        "Fiordo di Furore has no beach clubs, no bathrooms, and only the occasional mobile snack cart in peak season. Pack water, snacks, and something comfortable to sit on — the pebbles are coarse and space is limited.",
        "Cliff jumping happens from the rocks beside the bridge, but always check the depth first and jump only where locals are already in the water. Respect the swimmers below and keep an eye on the tides; the cove gets shady by late afternoon."
