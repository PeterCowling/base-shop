# Synthesis Prompt - MARKET-05 Assumptions and risk register

Objective: consolidate MARKET-01..MARKET-04 outputs into a single assumptions and risk register.

Required output sections:
1. Top assumptions (statement, dependency, confidence).
2. Risk register (risk, impact, likelihood, mitigation).
3. Evidence conflicts and required resolution artifacts.
4. Decision-critical unknowns to resolve before offer finalization.
5. Ready-for-offer checklist.

Rules:
- Do not add assumptions without traceable upstream evidence.
- Keep each risk tied to a concrete stage artifact or source.
- Mark blocking vs non-blocking unknowns.
