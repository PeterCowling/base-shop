## Score Rationale

**O1 — Bag charm**
- Launch feasibility PASS: product exists; photograph and list on Etsy in 2–4 weeks with <€200 cost.
- Distribution PASS: Etsy (active sub-market), Instagram/TikTok (primary discovery channel for this category), boutique consignment entry model.
- Regulatory PASS: No CE marking required for adult fashion accessories; EU textile labelling is straightforward.
- Problem fit PASS: Directly addresses the "fashion-conscious woman who cannot find a premium artisan accessory for her bag" problem as stated.

**O2 — AirPod holder**
- Launch feasibility PASS: product exists; size fit validated (TASK-03 complete per plan). 2–4 week launch.
- Distribution PASS: Etsy (active AirPod case sub-market), Instagram. Carolina Herrera's $145–$210 AirPod charm line proves fashion-house consumer will pay at this tier.
- Regulatory PASS: Leather AirPod case with no electronics — no CE marking, no tech compliance.
- Problem fit PASS: Directly addresses the problem (the €55–$930 AirPod holder price gap is a clear articulation of the binary the buyer faces).

**O3 — Destination souvenir**
- Launch feasibility PASS (conditional): Can launch at Brikette reception immediately with existing stock. Requires custom location graphics to fully execute the "place prestige + artisan credibility" story; that step takes 4–8 weeks. Conditional on operator availability during tourist season (June–September).
- Distribution FLAG (seasonal): In-destination channel is only available June–September. Not a viable year-round primary channel. Strong as a secondary channel alongside O1/O2 DTC.
- Regulatory PASS: Standard Italian retail labelling; street market "licenza di vendita temporanea" for any outdoor selling. No barrier.
- Problem fit PASS: Directly addresses the destination tourist group problem. Positano leather sandal market (€100–€250) proves the buyer exists and the spend level is real.
- Rationale for conditional shortlist: Not a standalone primary option but a seasonal channel layer on top of O1/O2. Carry forward as a parallel track rather than a primary route.

**O4 — Dog accessories holder**
- Launch feasibility PASS: Product modification minor; can photograph and list quickly.
- Distribution FLAG: Dog accessory channel (boutique pet stores, niche Instagram) is distinct from the fashion channel. Requires a separate audience-building effort with no crossover from the handbag personaliser ICP. Distribution is not impossible but requires a separate go-to-market effort.
- Regulatory PASS: No CE marking for adult dog accessories.
- Problem fit FLAG: The stated problem is about fashion-conscious handbag owners. Dog accessories targets a different ICP (dog owner, not handbag personaliser). The product address a *different* problem, not the one in the problem statement. An artisan dog holder is a viable product concept but it is not the solution to this problem.
- **Elimination rationale:** Problem fit FLAG — addresses a different customer and a different problem than the one framed in problem-statement.user.md. May be revisited as a product extension after core ICP is validated, but should not be the first market entry.

**O5 — Children's first bag**
- Launch feasibility FLAG: CE marking research required before marketing to the children's segment. Timeline to CE certification: weeks to months depending on product composition. Hard time constraint before launch is allowed.
- Distribution PASS: Etsy children's gift market exists.
- Regulatory FAIL: CE marking under Toy Safety Directive / General Product Safety Regulation is likely required for a product marketed to children under 14 in the EU/UK. Small parts / choking hazard assessment also required. This is not an insurmountable long-term barrier, but it is a hard block at this stage.
- Problem fit FLAG: The stated problem targets women 27–42 buying for themselves or as gifts for peers. The children's market is a different problem and a different buyer.
- **Elimination rationale:** Regulatory FAIL — CE marking hard block before marketing is allowed in EU/UK. Additionally, problem fit FLAG — different customer segment. Defer until TASK-09 (CE marking investigation) is complete.

**O6 — Premium gift set**
- Launch feasibility FLAG: Requires secondary item sourcing, packaging design, and additional supply chain complexity. Not launchable in 2–4 weeks.
- Distribution FLAG: Gift set distribution channels (boutique gift retail, premium gifting platforms) require separate relationships from the fashion accessories channels for O1/O2.
- Regulatory PASS (conditional on secondary items).
- Problem fit PARTIAL: Gift set addresses Group 3 (gift buyer) but wraps the core product in additional complexity without validating whether the core product has demand on its own.
- **Deferred rationale:** Adds supply chain complexity before core demand is validated. Revisit as a packaging/positioning layer after O1/O2 prove demand at the single-SKU level.

**O7 — Mini-SLG organiser**
- Launch feasibility PASS: existing product, no product development required.
- Distribution PASS: SLG/pouch channels are well-established (Etsy, boutique gifting).
- Regulatory PASS: No CE marking; standard EU product labelling.
- Problem fit PARTIAL: The Mini-SLG repositions the product as an inside-the-bag organiser. This addresses "keep my bag tidy" — a different JTBD from the stated problem ("make my bag feel unmistakably mine"). An organiser stored inside the bag provides no visible personalisation signal and does not address the bag charm identity JTBD.
- **Elimination rationale:** Problem Fit PARTIAL — addresses an organisation JTBD, not the bag personalisation problem stated in problem-statement.user.md. Revisit as a secondary SKU after O1/O2 validate core demand.

**O8 — Keyring / EDC pouch**
- Launch feasibility PASS: minimal product modification (add keyring chain).
- Distribution PASS: EDC/keychain pouches common in leather goods and gifting.
- Regulatory PASS: REACH nickel applies to keyring hardware; no CE marking.
- Problem fit PARTIAL: Functions as a variant of O1/O2 at keychain scale. Loses the "bag-on-a-bag" visual identity that drives the bag charm JTBD; is not a distinct product category.
- **Deferral rationale:** Overlaps functionally with O1 and O2. Does not introduce a distinct product category or JTBD. Revisit as a lower entry-price SKU (€55–€69) alongside O1/O2 after core demand is validated at €89–€119.

**O9 — Hospitality amenity / B2B channel**
- Launch feasibility PASS (conditional): No new product development. Main constraint is B2B cycle time — hotel pitch-to-decision typically 4–12 weeks. Feasible within 6 months if operator engages properties immediately with physical samples.
- Distribution PASS (conditional): Hospitality retail and concierge placement is a proven route for wearable souvenir items. The Positano hostel is an immediate pilot point; adjacent boutique hotels are the next step.
- Regulatory PASS: Same as O3. EU GPSR and product labelling apply; "made in" or "local artisan" claims must be truthful.
- Problem fit PASS: Addresses Group 2 (destination tourist) and Group 3 (premium gift buyer) through institutional mediation. Structurally this is O3 (destination souvenir) routed through B2B hospitality channels — the same product with institutional trust signals instead of DTC.
- **Shortlist rationale:** Not a standalone option — B2B channel extension of O3. Launch at the hostel first (zero B2B friction), then approach 2–3 Positano boutique hotels in the same tourist season with physical samples.

## Elimination Log

- **O4 — Dog accessories holder**: Eliminated on Problem Fit — addresses a different ICP (dog owner vs. handbag personaliser) and a different problem than the one stated in problem-statement.user.md. Viable product concept but not the solution to the framed problem.
- **O5 — Children's first bag**: Eliminated on Regulatory Burden — CE marking hard block under Toy Safety Directive / General Product Safety Regulation; hard block until TASK-09 complete. Also fails Problem Fit for the same ICP mismatch reason as O4.
- **O6 — Premium gift set**: Deferred (not eliminated) — adds supply chain complexity before core demand is proven; revisit as a wrapping layer for O1/O2 after validation.
- **O7 — Mini-SLG organiser**: Eliminated on Problem Fit PARTIAL — addresses organisation JTBD, not the stated bag personalisation problem. Revisit as a secondary SKU after core demand validated.
- **O8 — Keyring / EDC pouch**: Deferred (not eliminated) — overlaps functionally with O1/O2; no distinct JTBD or category addition. Revisit as a lower entry-price SKU (€55–€69) after O1/O2 validation.

## Shortlist

**1. O1 — Bag charm / handbag accessory (primary)**
The highest-signal first option. Market evidence is strongest (JOOR 12× wholesale growth, 700% Pinterest search growth, WhoWhatWear/BoF editorial confirmation). Lowest launch cost (<€200 in photography and listing). The 2026 style direction toward craft/material authenticity directly favours an Italian-provenance artisan charm. Primary ICP match (LV/Gucci-tier women, 27–42, fashion-aware). Proof test is a 10-day Etsy listing + Instagram post at full price. No competitor occupies the Italian-artisan-provenance position in this tier.

**2. O2 — AirPod holder / small-items case (co-primary)**
Runs in parallel with O1 — the product may be the same physical item tested with two different messaging angles. The AirPod holder targets the same ICP with a functional utility layer on top of the aesthetic story. Carolina Herrera's $145–$210 AirPod charm line is the direct proof-of-concept. The €55–$930 price gap is unoccupied by any artisan brand. AirPod fit confirmed (TASK-03 complete). Launch cost same as O1.

**O3 — Destination souvenir (conditional secondary track)**
Carry forward as a seasonal, parallel distribution channel rather than a standalone option. Does not require a separate product concept — it is O1/O2 repositioned with location context for the Amalfi destination buyer. Activate in season (June–September) after O1/O2 have generated initial demand signal online. Location graphics decision (Q4 in fact-find) gates the full execution.

→ **O9 (B2B extension of O3):** Within the same tourist season, approach 2–3 Positano boutique hotels with physical samples. Institutional endorsement from hotel concierge/gift shop accelerates Group 2 trust signals without additional product development. Launch at the hostel first (zero B2B friction); B2B hotel pitching follows once the product has in-hand social proof.

## Price Architecture (moved from S0A)

*Triangulated from market comparables — no primary Van Westendorp survey found for this category. See research appendix C.*

| Zone | Price (EUR) | Interpretation |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Obvious yes | €79–€95 | Below €100 barrier; Coach $95 charm is the real-world anchor |
| Hesitate | €110–€139 | Requires visible material + craft story; buyer must understand why more than Coach |
| No way (without brand proof) | €160+ | High friction for unbranded artisan; needs photography + named materials + social proof |

**Gross margin benchmark:** 60–67% DTC (Szoneier / BusinessDojo). At €99 selling price, COGS target ~€35. Net retained after Etsy fees (6.5%) + payment (3%) + packaging (~€3–5): ~€52–57/unit. TASK-02 COGS validation required.

**Recommended:** Launch O1 at €89 and O2 at €119 (functional utility justifies premium). After 10–20 reviews, introduce a named-material tier at €149.

**Recommended action:** Run 50–100 person Van Westendorp survey via Conjointly targeting women owning bags in the €400–€1,500 range. Cost ~€200–€500, 2–3 weeks. Generates defensible price-banding data before scaling.

## Style Direction (moved from S0A)

*DISCOVERY-02 signal; relevant to positioning all shortlisted options.*

Current trend (2025): playful maximalism — the antidote to quiet luxury. 2026 pivot: craft/material authenticity — vintage-inspired, no logos, texture, natural materials (WhoWhatWear 2026, JOOR). The Labubu/novelty phase is exhausting.

**Positioning instruction for O1/O2/O3:** Lean into materiality and craft, not character or novelty. The product's Italian context, leather quality, and Birkin-style structure are the story — not playfulness or pop-culture reference. "One considered charm that elevates" is the buyer's desired outcome; position there.

## Retention Model (moved from S0A)

*Relevant to option viability and offer design (S2B); captured here.*

Artisan bag accessories at €80–€150 are predominantly one-off or low-frequency purchases in the base case. Repurchase drivers:
1. **Collecting behaviour** — seasonal colourways/capsule drops. Collector segment (10–20% of buyers) returns 3–4×/year.
2. **Gift giving** — seasonal peaks at Q4, Valentine's Day, Mother's Day.
3. **Drop culture mechanics** — limited seasonal editions with scarcity messaging. 60% of FOMO purchases happen within 24 hours (Queue Fair).

Year 1 target: 15–20% repeat rate. Year 2+ with drop culture + email list: 25–35%. Seasonal drop mechanics are the highest-leverage retention tool.

## Decision

**Status: GO**

**Carry forward to DISCOVERY-04 (naming handoff):** O1 (bag charm) and O2 (AirPod holder) as co-primary options. O3 (destination souvenir) as a conditional seasonal channel layer, with O9 (hospitality B2B) as a channel extension of O3 in the same tourist season.

Proceed to `/lp-do-discovery-04-business-name-options --business HBAG` with the above options in scope. The naming research should accommodate a brand name that works across O1, O2, and O3 — not one that is tied to a single product type.
