  "intro": [
    "Fiordo di Furore (sometimes called the “Furore fjord”) is one of the Amalfi Coast’s most dramatic swim spots: a narrow gorge of turquoise water, sheer rock walls, and a stone bridge high above. It looks like a secret beach, but it is tiny and raw — no beach clubs, limited space, and steep stairs down to the water.",
    "This guide is written for hostel guests who want the classic photo and a quick swim without turning the day into a stressful logistics mission. We’ll cover how to reach the gorge by SITA bus, what to pack because there are almost no services, and how to time your return so you are not stuck on the roadside as buses pass full.",
    "Staff tip from our front desk: treat Fiordo di Furore as a short “anchor stop” (60–120 minutes on-site) and pair it with a bigger, service-friendly cove like %LINK:marinaDiPraiaBeaches|Marina di Praia% or a sunset-focused beach day at %LINK:gavitellaBeachGuide|Gavitella in Praiano%."
