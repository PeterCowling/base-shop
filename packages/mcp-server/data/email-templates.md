## Booking Issues

### Why cancelled

```
Dear Guest,

Thank you for your email.

Please be aware that once a 'pre-paid, non-refundable' booking is made, our system will follow these steps:

   1. You will be prompted to opt-in to our terms and conditions.
   2. Upon receiving your opt-in, we will attempt to process the payment.

To ensure your booking is successfully completed, we recommend:

   - Check your email for the opt-in request and payment confirmation.
   - Look in your spam or junk folder if you do not see these emails in your inbox.

You may also wish to ensure that emails from us do not go into spam in the future, as further emails will be sent by us that are essential to your stay at the hostel, and others will be useful (how best to get here etc.).

If either of these steps is not completed, the booking may be cancelled.

Unfortunately, cancelled bookings cannot be reinstated.

Regards,

Peter Cowling
Owner

Dear Guest,

Thank you for choosing to stay with us. We appreciate your reservation.

As per the booking option you selected, we need to collect the remaining balance prior to your arrival. We tried but were unable to do so.

As per Hostelworld policy, we will make three attempts to run the transaction, after which the booking will be cancelled. It is important to note that if your booking is cancelled:

   - Whether you are refunded your deposit will depend on the type of booking you made with your booking agent, Hostelworld. We are not involved in this process since the money is not paid to us.
   - The hostel has high demand. Once a booking is cancelled it will not be reinstated.

We will make a second attempt to process the transaction tomorrow. In the meantime, we recommend checking that your account has sufficient funds and that your bank allows international transactions. If you prefer to use a different payment method, please let us know so that we can provide you with a secure link to provide the necessary details.

We appreciate your attention to this matter, and we look forward to having you as our guest soon.

## Cancellation

### Cancellation of Non-Refundable Booking

```
Dear Guest,

Thank you for contacting us, and sorry to hear of this issue. We can cancel your booking, but before we do we would like to take this opportunity to explain the specific details of your booking and its eligibility for a refund.

We offer two types of bookings to our customers, one that is not paid in advance and will not incur a fee on cancellation provided it is cancelled within the cancellation period, and the other is the 'pre-paid, non-refundable' type, which is the type of booking you have made. This policy is put in place to provide revenue security, which in turn allows us to offer a discounted rate to our customers. By securing a guaranteed revenue stream, we can afford to pass on savings to our customers.

As the name suggests, pre-paid bookings require payment in advance, and once payment has been made, they become non-refundable. We understand that there may be circumstances beyond your control that could prevent you from using your pre-paid booking, such as illness, flight cancellations, or other unforeseen events. However, as stated in our terms and conditions, pre-paid bookings are non-refundable. We always advise our customers to carefully consider the pros and cons of such bookings and to read the terms and conditions carefully before making any commitments. We also recommend that customers consider purchasing appropriate travel insurance to protect themselves in case of unforeseen events.

If you have any further queries, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Thank you for choosing to book with us.

Regards,

Peter Cowling

Owner
```

### No Show

```
Dear Guest,

We regret to hear that you were unable to join us for your stay at our hostel.

Please be advised that your booking has been cancelled. Should you need any assistance regarding this matter, feel free to reach out to us.

We hope you have a wonderful time during your travels, and look forward to the possibility of hosting you at another time.

Best regards,

Peter Cowling

Owner

## Policies

### Alcohol Policy

```
Dear Guests in Room Nine,

We hope you are enjoying your stay at the hostel.

This morning, our cleaning crew removed a bottle of tequila from your room. If this item belongs to you, please visit the front desk to collect it either upon checkout or when you plan to head out and intend to consume them *outside* the hostel.

Please be reminded that bringing alcohol purchased outside of the hostel into the premises is against our policy, as stated in the room rules, terms, and conditions for room booking. As a licensed property, we must regulate alcohol consumption on-site.

We kindly ask for your cooperation with this rule to ensure compliance with legal requirements. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in the discontinuation of your stay with us.

Thank you for your understanding.

Regards,

Peter Cowling

Owner
```

### Age Restriction

```
Dear Guest,

Thank you for your understanding as we explain our age-related policy. We implemented this policy in response to various complaints we received concerning the atmosphere in our establishment.

Previously, we encountered situations where guests reported feeling uncomfortable due to the presence of older individuals in the dormitories. These complaints were often vague and difficult to verify, which led to challenging decisions.

Initially, we attempted to be flexible with the policy, admitting guests who assured us they were easygoing. Unfortunately, despite their assurances, some of these guests later complained about noise levels.

As a result, we have decided to adhere more strictly to our policy during peak seasons to minimize risks and maintain a comfortable environment for all our guests. During the start and end of the season, when risks are more manageable, we can be more flexible.

We acknowledge that this policy may not be ideal for everyone, but we believe it is preferable to the alternative. We appreciate your understanding and thank you for allowing us to clarify our position on this matter.

Best regards,

Peter Cowling

Owner
```
