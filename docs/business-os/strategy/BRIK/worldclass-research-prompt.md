## Section (a) — Business Context

```
Business: BRIK
Business type: Boutique hostel, Positano, Amalfi Coast, Italy
Operator-stated goal version: 1
Goal set on: 2026-02-27
```

**Additional context for grounding:**

Brikette is a small boutique hostel situated in Positano on the Amalfi Coast, one of Italy's most visually iconic coastal destinations. The property operates under the brand name Brikette, targeting international independent travellers (IIT) — primarily young women aged 18–35 (99% female, 60% aged 18–25) alongside the broader IIT segment aged 25–45. The brand personality is warm, inviting, expressive, and modern — Mediterranean sunset tones (coral and gold), friendly geometric typography (Plus Jakarta Sans). The brand is deliberately positioned as boutique and affordable-luxury: not a budget party hostel, but not a luxury hotel either.

The hostel's current booking stack uses **Octorate** as its property management system and booking engine. The website serves as the primary direct-booking channel, competing against OTA listings (Booking.com, Hostelworld, Airbnb). Summer-peak seasonality is central to the business — the Amalfi Coast is strongly seasonal, with peak demand from June–September and shoulder seasons in April–May and October.

The operator's goal is to build a world-class direct-booking website that uses Positano's extraordinary visual appeal as the primary conversion lever, integrates Octorate cleanly at room level, and actively pulls visitors away from OTA links through trust, pricing transparency, and a compelling direct-booking value proposition.

## Section (b) — Singular Goal (verbatim)

```
Singular goal: "As soon as possible, BRIK has a world-class boutique hostel website for Positano with professional imagery and some level of video material, room-level pages with an embedded Octorate funnel, and a direct-booking CTA hierarchy that outcompetes OTA links."
```

## Section (c) — Domain-by-Domain Research Instructions

#### Website Imagery & Video

Context: Photography and video across the site — hero shots, room galleries, outdoor/terrace imagery, lifestyle content, and at minimum one short video clip (property walkthrough, location reel, or atmosphere loop). For a coastal Positano property the visual material must convey the location as the primary selling point while keeping a boutique, affordable-luxury feel. Excludes booking funnel UX and direct-booking incentive messaging (see Room-Level Booking Funnel and Direct Booking Conversion).

Reference points provided by operator:
- Passalacqua hotel website (Lake Como) — imagery quality and light direction only; ignore positioning and budget level
- La Minervetta Sorrento — authentic sense-of-place photography with short atmospheric video loop
- Airbnb Plus listings in Amalfi Coast — high dynamic range, natural light
- Generator Hostels video content — short property walkthrough reels embedded on homepage and room pages

Research task:
For this domain, identify:
1. What does world-class look like right now (2025–2026)? Name 3–5 specific exemplars with concrete evidence of what makes them world-class in this domain.
2. What are the key indicators that distinguish world-class from merely good? List 5–8 measurable or observable indicators.
3. What is the minimum threshold — the lowest standard that could still be considered competitive — for a business of this type and scale?
4. What are the most common gaps between current-practice hospitality/boutique hostel operators and world-class in this domain?

---

#### Room-Level Booking Funnel

Context: The journey from room/bed listing page through to booking completion. Covers information hierarchy, pricing display, availability calendar UX, and how the Octorate widget is integrated so it does not feel like a third-party interruption. Excludes broader direct-booking incentives and price-match messaging (see Direct Booking Conversion).

Reference points provided by operator:
- Generator Hostels — clean bed-type selector with real-time pricing
- Selina properties — room cards with photo, feature list, and inline CTA
- Hostelworld top-performer listings — social proof placement within funnel

Research task:
For this domain, identify:
1. What does world-class look like right now (2025–2026)? Name 3–5 specific exemplars with concrete evidence of what makes them world-class in this domain.
2. What are the key indicators that distinguish world-class from merely good? List 5–8 measurable or observable indicators.
3. What is the minimum threshold — the lowest standard that could still be considered competitive — for a business of this type and scale?
4. What are the most common gaps between current-practice hospitality/boutique hostel operators and world-class in this domain?

---

#### Direct Booking Conversion

Context: Everything that nudges a visitor who found the hostel via OTA or search to book direct instead. Covers price-match messaging, loyalty incentives, trust signals, and how the direct-booking CTA competes with OTA links appearing elsewhere on the page. Excludes room-page information architecture and booking widget UX (see Room-Level Booking Funnel).

Reference points provided by operator:
- Uku Hostel (Porto) — prominent "Book Direct — Best Price" strip
- The Student Hotel — member-rate framing on homepage hero
- Beds&Dreams hostels — cancellation policy clarity as conversion lever

Research task:
For this domain, identify:
1. What does world-class look like right now (2025–2026)? Name 3–5 specific exemplars with concrete evidence of what makes them world-class in this domain.
2. What are the key indicators that distinguish world-class from merely good? List 5–8 measurable or observable indicators.
3. What is the minimum threshold — the lowest standard that could still be considered competitive — for a business of this type and scale?
4. What are the most common gaps between current-practice hospitality/boutique hostel operators and world-class in this domain?

## Section (d) — Output Format Specification

## Required output format

The result of this research must be saved as a Markdown document with the following structure.

Frontmatter:
```
---
schema_version: worldclass-benchmark.v1
business: BRIK
goal_version: 1
generated_at: <YYYY-MM-DD when research was run>
domains:
  - id: website-imagery-video
    name: Website Imagery & Video
  - id: room-level-booking-funnel
    name: Room-Level Booking Funnel
  - id: direct-booking-conversion
    name: Direct Booking Conversion
---
```

Body: one top-level section per domain, using EXACTLY this heading format:
```
## [website-imagery-video] Website Imagery & Video
## [room-level-booking-funnel] Room-Level Booking Funnel
## [direct-booking-conversion] Direct Booking Conversion
```

Under each domain section, include ALL FOUR of these subsections:

### Current Best Practice
<2–4 paragraph description of what world-class looks like in this domain right now, with named exemplars>

### Exemplars
<Bullet list of 3–5 named exemplars with a one-sentence description of what makes each world-class in this domain>

### Key Indicators
<Bullet list of 5–8 measurable or observable indicators that distinguish world-class from merely good>

### Minimum Threshold
<1–2 sentences: the lowest bar a business of this type and scale must clear to be considered competitive in this domain>

Do not add extra sections. Do not merge domains. If a domain has no strong exemplars available, note that explicitly in the Exemplars section rather than omitting it.

## Section (e) — Constraints to Respect

## Constraints for this research

All findings, exemplars, and recommendations must be compatible with the following constraints.
- Coastal Italy (Positano, Amalfi Coast) — imagery, video, and copy must reflect the Mediterranean setting and summer-peak seasonality
- Boutique / affordable-luxury positioning — benchmark references must not be luxury-only properties with budgets out of reach for a small hostel operator
- Booking engine is Octorate — funnel recommendations must work within or around the Octorate widget, not require a full engine replacement
- Primary booking audience is international independent travellers (IIT) aged 25-45, English as lingua franca for the site
- Video requirement is "some level" — a short atmospheric clip or location reel is sufficient; full-production brand film is out of scope

Research that violates these constraints (e.g. recommending luxury-only solutions for an affordable-luxury operator) should be explicitly flagged as out-of-scope and replaced with the closest in-scope alternative.
