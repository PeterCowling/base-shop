# Packaging Regulatory Requirements — Reference Data

**Scope:** EU primary jurisdiction. UK and US divergence notes included where significant. Operator must verify jurisdiction-specific requirements before production. This file covers four common categories for early-stage consumer product startups.

**How this file is used:** `/lp-do-assessment-15-packaging-brief` reads this file to populate the Regulatory Requirements Checklist section of the packaging brief. The checklist is then reviewed and confirmed by the operator before production.

**Last updated:** 2026-02-26

## Category 1: Fashion and Leather Goods (Textiles and Accessories)

### Mandatory Label Fields (EU)

| Field | Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Fibre composition | % by weight of each fibre ≥ 3%; fibres < 3% may be listed as "other fibres" | EU Textile Regulation 1007/2011 |
| Care symbols | ISO 3758 standard care symbols (wash, bleach, dry, iron, dry clean) | ISO 3758:2012; symbols preferred over text in EU |
| Country of origin | Required only if "Made in" claim is made on packaging; otherwise not mandatory in EU | Optional unless claim is made |
| Business address | Responsible person (manufacturer or EU importer) name and address | EU Textile Regulation 1007/2011 |
| Size | EU size or size range; no standard mandated but must be present | Industry convention; varies by product type |

### Leather-Specific Notes

| Field | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Hide origin claim | No EU regulation mandates hide origin disclosure; however, stating "Italian leather" triggers origin claim rules |
| Italian-made claims | "Made in Italy" requires substantial manufacturing in Italy: Italian Law 166/2009 applies; includes design, cut, and assembly in Italy |
| Exotic / protected species | CITES documentation required if exotic leathers (crocodile, ostrich, python) — not applicable to standard cow/lamb leather |

### Structural Packaging Note

Typical format: hang tag (care + fibre content) + poly bag or dust bag.
- Hang tag minimum: fibre composition, care symbols, brand, size, price (retail only).
- Leather goods (bags, wallets): dust bag recommended, care card inside.
- No mandatory outer carton for fashion accessories unless required by retailer.

### Jurisdiction Notes

- **UK post-Brexit:** UK retained EU Textile Regulation (UK Textiles Regulation SI 2012/1102). Label requirements are substantively the same. "UKCA" marking now required for some textile articles sold in Great Britain.
- **US:** Care Instruction Rule (16 CFR Part 423, FTC) mandates care labels sewn into garments. Separate from EU care symbol system. Leather goods: no federal care label requirement.

## Category 2: Homeware and Ceramics

### Mandatory Label Fields (EU)

| Field | Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Business identity | Manufacturer or EU importer name and address | General product safety baseline |
| Country of origin | Not mandated for homeware except if origin claim is made | Optional unless claim is made |
| Lead / cadmium limits | Food-contact ceramics must meet migration limits: lead ≤ 0.8 mg/dm² (flat items), cadmium ≤ 0.07 mg/dm² (flat items) | EU Ceramics Directive 84/500/EEC |
| "Not for food use" marking | Required on decorative ceramics that do not meet food-contact limits | EU Ceramics Directive 84/500/EEC |
| CE marking | Required if product has a function that brings it under a specific directive (e.g., electrical appliances). Decorative ceramics without electrical components: CE not required | Assess per product type |

### Safety Notes

| Risk | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Sharp edges / breakage risk | Must comply with General Product Safety Directive (GPSD) 2001/95/EC. No specific sharp-edge limit but consumer safety standard EN 71-1 (toys) is often referenced for context |
| Non-food-contact use | Clearly label if item is decorative only and not intended for food contact |

### Structural Packaging Note

Typical format: folding cardboard box or sleeve with protective cushioning (tissue or foam insert).
- Box exterior: brand, country of origin (if claimed), responsible business contact.
- Fragile items: "Fragile" handling mark recommended.
- No mandatory outer carton but retail buyers often require branded shipping box.

### Jurisdiction Notes

- **UK:** UK retained EU Ceramics Directive requirements under domestic law.
- **US:** FDA regulates lead and cadmium limits for food-contact ceramics under 21 CFR Parts 109 and 189. Limits differ from EU — verify before exporting to US.

### Structural Packaging Note

Typical format: primary packaging (tube, jar, pump bottle) + optional secondary carton.
- Primary label must carry INCI list, responsible person, durability, batch code.
- Secondary carton (if used): may carry the same information plus promotional text.
- Inner packaging (e.g., sachet inside carton): must carry at minimum batch code and best-before / PAO.

### Jurisdiction Notes

- **UK post-Brexit:** UK Cosmetics Regulation (UK Cosmetics Regulation SI 2019/696) closely mirrors EU regulation. UK responsible person required separately from EU. CPNP replaced by SCPN (UK's Submit Cosmetic Product Notification system).
- **US:** FDA regulates cosmetics under FD&C Act. No pre-market approval (except colour additives). No INCI notification portal equivalent. Required label elements differ: ingredient list in English by common name (not INCI), net weight in US customary and metric. No PAO requirement.

## EAN / Barcode Requirements

| Channel | Barcode Required? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Retail (supermarkets, department stores, independent shops) | Yes | EAN-13 (Europe) or UPC-A (US) barcode required for point-of-sale scanning |
| Online marketplace (Amazon, Etsy, etc.) | Platform-dependent | Amazon requires GTIN/EAN for most categories. Etsy: not required. Check platform-specific rules. |
| D2C e-commerce (own website) | No | Not required for direct checkout; consider adding for future retail readiness |
| Market stalls and pop-ups | No | Not required unless the event POS system uses scanning |

**GS1 Registration:** To obtain a valid EAN barcode prefix, register with GS1 — the authoritative issuing organisation. Visit gs1.org/get-a-barcode. One-time registration fee plus annual licence. Barcodes self-assigned without a GS1 prefix are invalid for retail.

## Multi-Category Edge Cases

Some products span two regulatory categories. Apply requirements from BOTH applicable categories:

| Example | Categories | Key complication |
|---|---|---|
| Scented candle | Cosmetics (if skin-contact claim) + Homeware | Cosmetics Regulation applies if the candle makes skin-care claims; otherwise GPSD + fragrance safety rules |
| Food supplement (capsules/tablets) | Food (if presented as food) + Cosmetics (if topical) | If ingested: EU Food Supplements Directive 2002/46/EC applies; not covered in this file — seek specialist advice |
| Cosmetic with SPF claim | Cosmetics | UV filter Annex VI restrictions apply; sunscreen efficacy testing required |
| Textile with cosmetic treatment (e.g., moisturising socks) | Textiles + Cosmetics | Both Textile Regulation and Cosmetics Regulation apply; borderline classification — seek specialist advice |

When a product spans two categories, the agent should note both sets of requirements in the checklist and direct the operator to verify the classification before production.

## Out-of-Scope Categories

The following categories require specialist regulatory expertise and are NOT covered by this reference file. The agent must not attempt to produce a regulatory checklist for these categories — instead, direct the operator to seek professional regulatory advice:

| Category | Reason |
|---|---|
| Medical devices | EU MDR 2017/745 — CE marking, clinical evaluation, notified body involvement; highly complex |
| Pharmaceuticals | EU Directive 2001/83/EC — marketing authorisation required; not applicable to consumer product startups |
| Electrical / electronic goods | EU Low Voltage Directive 2014/35/EU + EMC Directive 2014/30/EU + WEEE Directive 2012/19/EU; requires CE marking and testing |
| Children's toys | EU Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC — CE marking, EN 71 testing, safety assessment; specialist domain |
| Nutritional supplements | EU Food Supplements Directive 2002/46/EC + Novel Foods Regulation 2015/2283 — complex health claim rules |
| Organic / certified products | Certification body involvement required (e.g., Soil Association, COSMOS); not covered here |
