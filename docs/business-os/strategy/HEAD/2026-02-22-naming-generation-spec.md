# HEAD — Naming Generation Spec (ASSESSMENT-04 Part 1)

---

## 1. What this brand is

HEAD is a lifestyle DTC accessories brand for people who wear external cochlear implant (CI) processors. Launch hero product: a soft retention headband that keeps the processor on through a full day of school, play, and sport — without clinical framing. The product range extends into organiser pouches, parts pods, identity patch packs, sport bands, and compatible daily-carry accessories.

The brand exists because the current options are either manufacturer gear (brand-locked, clinical register) or fragmented third-party products with no coherent system or Italian-language support. The gap is not product absence — it is coherence, lifestyle positioning, and routine design.

**What "lifestyle" means for HEAD specifically:** ordinary (part of getting dressed and leaving the house), capable (survives play, school, sport, commuting), organised (kit always complete and findable), self-expressive (chosen colours and patches), and caregiver-relief (stop monitoring, fewer handover failures) — without implying improved hearing outcomes.

**Brand register:** apparel / EDC / accessories. The name must feel like it belongs to a brand selling lifestyle products, not a clinic, not a wellness spa, not an Italian craft studio. Think Bellroy, Tula, Aer — clean, confident, modern coinages.

**Hard register bans:** anything that would make a competent naming expert say "that sounds like an Italian spa brand, an artisan textile studio, a wellness supplement, or a medical device." All four registers are out.

**Primary buyer:** parent/caregiver of child CI wearer (Italy-first, mobile, high intent, practical). **Secondary:** active teen/adult CI wearer. **Purchase drivers:** everyday confidence, comfort, knowing the kit is sorted. **Blockers:** clinical tone, unclear compatibility claims, names that sound like device manufacturers.

---

## 2. ICP resonance anchor

**Primary test:** Would an Italian parent scrolling a CI caregiver group on mobile stop at this name and think "that looks like a brand I'd trust for my child's kit" — in under 3 seconds?

**The I dimension is the decision gate.** D, W, P, E are qualifications. I is the reason to buy. A technically clean name that an Italian caregiver scrolls past is a failed name.

**The spa/wellness failure test (apply before I scoring):** If the name sounds like an Italian spa, a herbal supplement, a slow-living lifestyle blog, or a Tuscany craft brand — it fails regardless of other scores. This is the single biggest quality failure from prior rounds.

---

## 3. Scoring rubric

### D — Distinctiveness
- **5:** Fully invented, low competitor confusion risk, strong TM ownability signal
- **4:** Coined/suggestive with limited collision exposure
- **3:** Some uniqueness but crowded phonetic territory
- **2:** Generic or category-near wording likely to collide
- **1:** Directly confusable with known competitors or clinical brands

### W — Wordmark quality
- **5:** 6–12 letters, strong visual rhythm, clean in uppercase/lowercase, handle-friendly
- **4:** Solid mark with minor visual constraints
- **3:** Functional but forgettable
- **2:** Too long/cluttered/awkward letter pairs
- **1:** Weak as a wordmark

### P — Phonetic quality
- **5:** Smooth in Italian + English, low friction pronunciation
- **4:** Mostly smooth with minor edge cases
- **3:** Pronounceable but unremarkable
- **2:** Awkward in one launch language
- **1:** Hard to pronounce reliably

### E — Expansion headroom
- **5:** Works across the full CI lifestyle accessory range (headbands, pouches, patches, pods, sport)
- **4:** Strong extension potential with small category pull
- **3:** Mildly product-anchored but still extendable
- **2:** Feels specific to one SKU
- **1:** Category-trapped

### I — ICP resonance (**weighted gate: see §3.1**)
- **5:** Immediately trusted and emotionally resonant for caregiver ICP as warm, practical, lifestyle — feels like an accessories brand they'd follow
- **4:** On-tone and credible for core audience; clearly lifestyle not clinical
- **3:** Neutral — neither strong trust nor strong rejection (⚠️ GATE FAIL — see §3.1)
- **2:** Too spa-like, too craft-studio, too clinical, or too generic to trust
- **1:** Actively wrong — clinical, corporate, concealment-coded, claim-like, or Italian-wellness-spa coded

**Composite score:** D + W + P + E + I (max 25)

### 3.1 I hard gate

**Any candidate scoring I ≤ 3 is eliminated and must not appear in the output table, regardless of total score.**

Before assigning an I score, apply this test:
1. *Spa/wellness test:* Does it sound like an Italian spa, herbal supplement, or slow-living lifestyle blog? → I = 2 or 1 → eliminate.
2. *Scroll test:* Would a CI caregiver parent scrolling on mobile stop at this name and feel something — recognition, warmth, "that looks practical"? If the honest answer is "probably not" → I = 3 → eliminate.

Names scoring I = 3 are invented without being felt. Do not include them.

## 4. Generation patterns, pools, and territories

### 4.0 Territory integrity requirements (mandatory pre-generation gate)

Before generating any candidates, verify the five territories in §4.3 pass all three collapse tests. If any test fails, revise the failing territory's word bank — not the territory concept — before generating.

**Test 1 — Probe generation:** Write 3 plausible candidate names from each territory's word bank (15 names total), using only that territory's semantic type and example vocabulary.

**Test 2 — Swap test:** Attempt to relabel each of the 15 probe names to a different territory. If any name fits equally well in two territories, those territories have collapsed. Tighten the word banks until no probe name is swappable.

**Test 3 — Brand test:** Treat each territory as a standalone competing brand. Are all 5 clearly different brands — different product focus, different register, different word choices? If two feel like the same brand with a different name, separate them further.

#### Territory definition requirements

Every territory in §4.3 must carry all four fields. If any field is missing, the territory is incomplete and must not be used for generation.

| Field | What it must contain |
|---|---|
| **Situation anchor** | One specific sentence: a person, a product, and a moment. Not a feeling. A scene. |
| **Semantic type** | The grammatical class this territory draws from. Different territories must have different types. |
| **Generates vocabulary like** | 6–8 example words derived from the situation anchor, not from aesthetic intuition. |
| **Banned from other territories** | 3–5 words from this pool that must not appear in any other territory's pool. |

---

### 4.1 Pattern targets

| Pattern | Count | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| A | 60 | Meaning-anchored morpheme combinations — draw from §4.2 pools; both elements should share a territory (see §4.3); both must carry semantic weight from that territory's word bank |
| B | 65 | English respellings with Italian suffix — source word must come from the territory word banks in §4.3; see §4.2 for allowed/blocked concept lists per territory |
| C | 45 | Fragment blends from the territory word banks — draw fragments from §4.3 IT and EN words; not random syllables; each fragment must point to a specific territory |
| D | 0 | **Hard-blocked** — compound-domain names (name + any suffix like -arte, -atelier, -casa, -studio, -care, -home, -co, -design, -shop) are eliminated |
| E | 80 | Real Italian words — drawn from the territory word banks in §4.3 and their semantic neighbourhood; must feel like a lifestyle accessories brand word, not spa/wellness/craft vocabulary |

**Total: 250**

---

### 4.2 Business-specific pools

#### First-element pool (Pattern A) — territory-anchored morphemes

Draw both elements of a Pattern A combination from the SAME territory wherever possible. Cross-territory blends must pass the spa/wellness test and the I gate pre-screen independently.

| Fragment | Semantic root | Territory |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| ten- | holds, keeps on — from tenere (to hold/keep) | Hair Secure |
| dur- | lasts, endures — stays on through the whole day | Hair Secure |
| man- | maintains — from mantenere (to maintain, to keep in place) | Hair Secure |
| wor- | worn, wearing — EN: worn all day, worn through | Hair Secure |

| tuoi- | yours — from tuoi/tuo (your/yours IT) | Part of You |
| abitu- | habitual, just how it is — from abitudine/abituato | Part of You |
| worn- | worn as part of you — EN: worn-as-self | Part of You |
| consuet- | accustomed, habitual, unremarkable routine | Part of You |
| mostr- | shows, displays — from mostrare (to show, to display) | Worn Out Loud |
| sfogg- | sports/flaunts — from sfoggiare (to sport/wear with flair) | Worn Out Loud |
| brill- | shines, stands out — from brillare (to shine, to stand out) | Worn Out Loud |
| spic- | stands out, is prominent — from spiccare (to stand out) | Worn Out Loud |
| out- | out, outward, visible — EN: out-there, out-front | Worn Out Loud |
| facil- | easy — from facile (easy, effortless) | Easy Hair System |
| semplic- | simple, no-fuss — from semplice (simple) | Easy Hair System |
| sub- | straight away, immediately — from subito (immediately) | Easy Hair System |
| sol- | alone, self-managed — from da solo (by oneself) | Easy Hair System |
| auton- | self-managing, independent — from autonomo | Easy Hair System |

#### Second-element pool (Pattern A) — territory-anchored endings

| Fragment | Semantic root | Territory |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| -tiene | it holds, it keeps | Hair Secure |
| -dura | it lasts, it endures | Hair Secure |
| -mane | it stays, it remains | Hair Secure |
| -stiva | stowed, safely packed | Organised Safe |
| -trova | found, located, there | Organised Safe |
| -tracci | tracked, accounted | Organised Safe |
| -propria | owned, truly yours | Part of You |
| -tuoi | yours, your own | Part of You |
| -abita | inhabited/worn as self | Part of You |
| -mostra | shows, displays | Worn Out Loud |
| -sfoggia | sports/displays with flair | Worn Out Loud |
| -brilla | shines, stands out | Worn Out Loud |
| -facile | easy, effortless | Easy Hair System |
| -subito | immediately, done | Easy Hair System |
| -sola | alone, self-managed | Easy Hair System |

**Also allowed as second elements (phonetically clean, territory-neutral):**
-ova, -iva, -ina, -ella, -era — use sparingly and only when the first element carries clear territory weight.

#### Concept pool (Pattern B) — allowed source words by territory

Each Pattern B name must draw its source word from the territory it belongs to. Do not mix.

**T1 — Hair Secure:** holds, lasts, stays, wears, kept, on, through, worn
**T2 — Organised Safe:** stowed, sorted, found, tracked, safe, order, pod, pouch
**T3 — Part of You:** own, yours, worn, theirs, habit, every day, part
**T4 — Worn Out Loud:** shown, out, front, styled, bold, worn-out, there
**T5 — Easy Hair System:** easy, self, quick, done, sorted, simple, just

**Hard-blocked from all Pattern B** (clinical, concealment, or force register):
anchor, comfort, secure, fix, grip, support, fit, flex, trust, fabric, weave, routine, hide, discreet, invisible, silent, calm, nest, silk, feather, thread, dawn, dusk, breeze, velvet, weave, craft, loom, morning, caressa/carezza-style spa words.

---

### 4.3 Emotional territories — required distribution

Every name must be tagged with one of these five territories. Aim for 40–60 names per territory. A name with no credible territory assignment fails the territory test in §7 and is eliminated.

**Territory test (apply before scoring):** "This name belongs to [territory] because it evokes [specific scene from that territory's situation anchor]." If you cannot name a specific scene — not a vague feeling — the name has no anchor and will score I ≤ 3 → eliminate.

---

#### Territory 1 — Hair Secure

**Product anchor:** retention headband (hero SKU)

**Situation anchor:** Child tumbles in PE class, runs through rain, swims at sports day — the headband is still in exactly the same position when they line up at the end. Nobody adjusted it. It just stayed.

**Semantic type:** Retention states (physical) — past participles and adjectives of staying put. The headband is held. It is worn all day. It endures. It keeps.

**Generates vocabulary like:** stays, holds, on, through, wears, lasted, kept, worn-all-day, doesn't shift, endures — and Italian adjacent: tiene (holds), dura (lasts), rimane (stays), tenuto (held/kept), durato (lasted), mantenuto (maintained in place)

**Banned from other territories:** holds, stays, lasted, tiene, dura — do not import these into T2/T3/T4/T5 pools

**Register check:** Should feel like a confident modern accessories brand whose primary message is "it just works, it stays put." Think premium athletic wear, everyday reliability. Not a medical device. Not a climbing harness. Not a spa.

**Territory-specific bans:** no kit/pouch/pod vocabulary (T2), no spa/nest/silk vocabulary, no force/grip/clamp vocabulary, no emotion/confidence vocabulary (T4), no ease/simplicity vocabulary (T5)

---

#### Territory 2 — Organised Safe

**Product anchor:** organiser pouch, parts pods, school spare kit bundle

**Situation anchor:** Parent opens the school bag in the evening — processor, batteries, coils, spare bands all in one pouch, exactly where they were put that morning. Nothing lost. Nothing hunted for. The kit is accounted for.

**Semantic type:** Container and order nouns — words naming things and their being-all-there. Stowed. Sorted. Tracked. Found where it was left.

**Generates vocabulary like:** stowed, sorted, found, tracked, pod, pouch, all-in, safe, accounted, ordered — and Italian adjacent: stivato (stowed), ordinato (in order), trovato (found), tracciato (tracked), custodito (kept/guarded), riposto (put away)

**Banned from other territories:** stowed, sorted, pod, pouch, tracciato — do not import these into T1/T3/T4/T5 pools

**Register check:** Should feel like an EDC / everyday-carry accessories brand (e.g., Bellroy, Peak Design). Practical, modern, organised. Not clinical medical storage. Not a school stationery brand. Not a wellness kit.

**Territory-specific bans:** no calm/nest/silk/warm vocabulary (spa register), no motion/sport vocabulary (T1/T4), no pride/display vocabulary (T4). No generic "organiser" register — warmer and more specific.

---

#### Territory 3 — Part of You

**Product anchor:** textile headbands in daily-wear context, colour variants

**Situation anchor:** Child is getting changed for PE and reaches for their headband without thinking — it is not a CI accessory, it is just what they wear, the way they wear a watch or a friendship bracelet. It belongs to them. It is part of their kit-of-self.

**Semantic type:** Belonging and habitual-identity words — words about something being owned, worn-as-self, so habitual it has become identity.

**Generates vocabulary like:** own, yours, theirs, worn, every day, just-what-they-wear, part, belong, identifies — and Italian adjacent: proprio (one's own), tuo/tuoi (yours), abituato (accustomed), consueto (habitual), di lei/di lui (theirs), portato (carried/worn — in the sense of always on them)

**Banned from other territories:** own, yours, proprio, tuo — do not import these into T1/T2/T4/T5 pools

**Register check:** Should feel like a contemporary everyday accessories brand (e.g., a hair accessories brand, an everyday jewellery brand). Ordinary is the point — the headband is no more remarkable than their shoes. Not clinical. Not craft. Not spa. Not disability-identity.

**Territory-specific bans:** no sport/motion words (T1/T4), no kit/pouch words (T2), no display/visible words (T4), no medical/device language, no disability/difference framing.

---

#### Territory 4 — Worn Out Loud

**Product anchor:** headband + patch packs — the visible, styled, outward-facing kit

**Situation anchor:** Child walks into class Monday morning — headband on, colour patches visible, doesn't hesitate or explain. Other kids notice the patches, not the device. The headband looks chosen. It looks styled. It is worn where people can see it, without a second thought.

**Semantic type:** Display and presence words — words about something being worn visibly and confidently in public. The vocabulary of showing, of being out there, of wearing it where it can be seen.

**Generates vocabulary like:** shown, out, front, styled, visible, worn-out-front, there, on-show, boldly, displayed — and Italian adjacent: mostra (shows), sfoggia (sports/wears with flair), brilla (shines/stands out), spicca (stands out), in vista (in view), esposto (exposed/visible)

**Banned from other territories:** shown, styled, sfoggia, mostra — do not import these into T1/T2/T3/T5 pools

**Register check:** Should feel like a personal accessories brand where the product is visible and desirable — like a bold watch strap, a bright bag, a visible pin collection. Confidence without drama. Not inspirational. Not disability-pride. Not "brave for wearing it." Ordinary cool.

**Territory-specific bans:** no "brave/proud" framing (inspirational-disability register); no "hiding" or "not hiding" (concealment framing); no clinical visibility-of-device language; no cute/kiddy diminutives.

---

#### Territory 5 — Easy Hair System

**Product anchor:** full kit (headband + organiser + pods), child self-managed

**Situation anchor:** Child manages their own headband and kit independently for the first time — no parental help, no fuss, done in the time it takes to put shoes on. The system is simple enough that a child runs it.

**Semantic type:** Ease and independence words — words about no-friction, self-managed, just-works. The vocabulary of done, sorted, simple, self.

**Generates vocabulary like:** easy, self, quick, done, sorted, simple, just-works, own-it, independent, no-fuss — and Italian adjacent: facile (easy), semplice (simple), subito (straight away/immediately), da solo (by oneself), autonomo (self-managing), pronto (ready — in the "done already" sense)

**Banned from other territories:** easy, facile, semplice, subito — do not import these into T1/T2/T3/T4 pools

**Register check:** Should feel like a brand that removes friction — like a no-setup consumer product, a child-friendly kit, something that just works. Not clinical. Not technical. Not a "therapy programme." The emphasis is on the child's independence and the system's simplicity.

**Territory-specific bans:** no patronising/special-needs language; no "as easy as X" comparisons; no clinical ease framing (e.g., "easy to use medical device"). No spa vocabulary.

---

## 5. Hard blockers and elimination lists

### 5.1 Hard blockers

**Domain rules (zero exceptions):**
- The registered .com domain must equal the brand name lowercased exactly: `<name>.com`
- **No compound-suffix domains:** any domain string that appends any suffix to the name (e.g., `-arte`, `-atelier`, `-casa`, `-studio`, `-care`, `-home`, `-co`, `-design`, `-shop`, `-kit`, `-co`, or any other suffix) is hard-blocked
- **No variant/double-vowel domains:** any domain requiring a repeated or modified vowel to achieve availability is hard-blocked
- Non-ASCII characters (è, à, ì, ò, ù) in the brand name are hard-blocked — the .com domain must be pure ASCII
- If the clean `<name>.com` is not available via RDAP, the name is eliminated. There is no fallback domain path.

**Category-level content bans (any failure = eliminate):**

*Medical/clinical drift:* hear, sound, restore, therapy, cure, treatment, rehabilitation, clinical, pro (in medical sense), medical, essential, cochlear, implant, device, processor (in the mark itself)

*Concealment drift:* hide, invisible, discreet, stealth, secret, camouflage, conceal

*Force/clamp register (sounds harsh + claimy):* clamp, lock, grip, tighten, anchor (standalone), secure (standalone), fix, clip (standalone — too product-specific)

*Spa/wellness/craft register (the primary failure mode from Rounds 1–4):* calma, morbida, seta, nido, brezza, piuma, trama, tela, filo, fiore, dolce, velluto, carezza, luce (standalone), alba, sera, rima, fiamma, caldo (standalone), cura (standalone), tenera (standalone), tessitura, artigianato, manifattura, cucitura, levigatura, ordito, intreccio — any word primarily associated with Italian spa/wellness/artisan-craft branding

**Structural bans:**
- No acronyms or initialisms
- No names scoring I ≤ 3 (see §3.1)

## 6. Output format

Generate a markdown table with exactly these columns:

```
| # | Name | Pattern | Territory | Provenance note | D | W | P | E | I | Score |
```

**Provenance note format:** Two parts separated by ` — `:
1. Structural origin (e.g., "morphemes ten+ova", "respelled from stays with -iva ending", "Italian: durata — endurance, lasting")
2. Territory tag (one of: `Hair Secure`, `Organised Safe`, `Part of You`, `Worn Out Loud`, `Easy Hair System`)

Example: `morphemes dur+ova — Hair Secure`

Sort by Score descending; ties by I descending, then alphabetically.

After the table, write a one-paragraph summary covering: territory distribution across the 250 names, which morpheme combinations produced the highest I scores, and which Pattern B source words proved most fruitful. Flag any territory that came in under 40 names.

## 7. Anti-criteria (hard rejection tests before scoring)

Before scoring any name, apply these rejection tests in order. A single failure eliminates the name — do not score it, do not include it in the table.

1. **Domain clean test:** Does `<name>.com` exist as the exact registered domain string with no suffix, no variant, no non-ASCII? If not → eliminate.
2. **Spa/wellness test:** Does this name sound like an Italian spa, herbal supplement, slow-living blog, or artisan craft studio? → I = 1 or 2 → eliminate.
3. **I gate pre-screen:** Would a CI caregiver parent scrolling on mobile stop at this name and feel something — "that looks practical, warm, a brand I'd trust for my child's kit"? If the honest answer is "probably not" → eliminate (I ≤ 3).
4. **Territory test:** Can you state which of the 5 territories this name belongs to in one specific sentence referencing a real situation from that territory? If not → no emotional anchor → likely I ≤ 3 → eliminate.
5. **Clinical test:** Does the name sound like a device manufacturer, clinical brand, or medical product? → eliminate.
6. **Category ban test:** Does the name use any word from the category-level ban list in §5.1? → eliminate.
7. **Territory-specific ban test:** Does the name use a word banned by its own territory (see §4.3)? → eliminate.
8. **Prior-round test:** Is this name (or a close phonetic variant) in §5.2, §5.3, §5.4, §5.5, or §5.6? → eliminate.
9. **Meaning test:** If both morpheme elements are semantically empty (chosen only for phonetic appeal, with no territory connection), the combination will score I ≤ 3 → eliminate.
