Execution Status

Status: Blocked — reviewer sign-off evidence not yet recorded

Inputs

docs/plans/brikette-seo-traffic-growth/task-18-gsc-links-baseline.md

Scope

This task covers:

Final outreach templates (warm + cold)

10 personalized draft openings + routing notes (ready for send in TASK-17)

A hard approval gate (checkboxes + timestamp + evidence pointer)

Template Guardrails

Editorial-only: no paid-link language, no exchanges, no incentives.

Concise + specific: reference a recently published/maintained Positano/Amalfi angle.

One value-add: a data point, correction, or practical on-the-ground update.

One CTA: a single, low-friction next step.

No demands: we offer copy they can use; they decide whether to include it.
