# LP Skill System Sequencing Plan (Stable Reference)

This file exists as a stable reference target for canonical Startup Loop docs.

The substantive plan content lives at:
- `docs/plans/archive/lp-skill-system-sequencing-plan.md`

## Reference Policy

- Canonical contract docs must link to a stable path under `docs/plans/` (not `docs/plans/archive/`).
- When a plan is archived, keep a shim at the stable path and record `Supersedes:` / `Superseded-by:` metadata.
- This avoids broken decision references when older plans are moved to archive.
