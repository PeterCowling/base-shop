## Round observations

**Max score dropped to 23 (R5 was 25).** The new territory vocabulary — stivare, sfoggiare, abitudine, mantenere — is harder to coin cleanly from than the R5 morpheme set. The -ella Pattern A names consistently outperform, producing the 5 top scorers.

**T4 (Worn Out Loud) is the hardest territory.** The sfoggiare root is unusual for a brand name, and most display/confidence words in English and Italian are already taken as domains. The best T4 names here (Sfogella, Showniva) work phonetically but the register is harder to instantly read as a lifestyle accessories brand.

**T1 (Hair Secure) Pattern B names cluster at 21.** Heldova, Staysiva, Worniva, Wearsiva are all clean and functional but none break through to 22+ because the source words (held, stays, wears) are simple enough to be somewhat generic.

**Exclusion note:** Spicova (T4 candidate, score 21) excluded — "spic" is a racial slur in English.

## Next step

Review the top 20. Select a name, or say "none of these work" (with optional reason) to encode new constraints for Round 7.
