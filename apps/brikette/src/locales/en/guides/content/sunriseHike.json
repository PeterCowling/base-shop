        "If you want to see the sunrise, you can observe it from the hostel's common area terrace as it rises to the left of the hostel (when looking out to sea).  However, for an even better view, you can hike up one of the nearby mountains.  Santa Maria del Castello is a good option, but we recommend the following hike for the best sunrise views"

        "To begin this hike, exit the hostel through the main door and walk down to the road. Then, walk 350 meters towards Sorrento on the main road. You will see a set of stairs leading up from the road, as shown in the photo below.",
        "To continue the hike, take the stairs and follow them until you reach a house, as shown in the photo below.",
        "To continue the hike, turn left at the house and follow the woodland trail.  The trail will branch, and you should follow the right branch.  The trail will eventually open out to a point where you can see the sea straight ahead of you. At this point, head around to your left.  This path will bring you to a vantage point where you can see the sunrise. From here, you can scramble up the rocks for an even better view or simply enjoy the view from where you are."
