    "**Skip the tourist traps and see Capri affordably.** You need: smart ferry timing (€20-25 return from Positano), free viewpoints that rival the paid ones, and cheap eats near the marinas. Skip the Blue Grotto—it's expensive and often closed. This guide shows you how to do Capri on €40-50 total from Hostel Brikette.",
    "**Best for:** Budget backpackers who want Instagram-worthy views without the luxury price tag. **Time needed:** Full day (7am-6pm).",
    "**Costs:** Ferry €20-25 return, chairlift €12 return (optional), food €10-15, bus €2-4. Total: €40-50. **What to know:** Book morning ferries early in summer; bring water and snacks; the free walks beat most paid attractions."

        "**Smart timing saves money:** Take the 8:15am or 9am ferry out (€11-13 one way). Return around 5pm-6pm to dodge the last-sailing chaos. In July-August, book 2-3 days ahead online to lock the cheaper rate. Off-season (Oct-May), show up at 8am and buy at the dock—you'll usually get space and save the booking fee.",
        "**From Salerno (if arriving by train):** Salerno-Capri ferries cost €18-22 return and take 1 hour. You'll arrive at Marina Grande same as the Positano ferry. Check %LINK:salernoPositanoBus|Salerno transport% if you're combining this with a Positano leg.",
        "**At Marina Grande:** You'll dock at the main port. Walk 50m right to the funicular (€2 each way) up to Capri town, or take the bus to Anacapri (€2). Don't take taxis—they charge €15-20 for a 5-minute ride."

Open 9:30am-5pm (shorter in winter). This is your one splurge—the views are unbeatable and it's far cheaper than the Blue Grotto.",
        "**Villa San Michele gardens (€10 entry, or free from outside):** The terrace has sweeping views. If you're tight on budget, walk to the public belvedere just past the villa entrance—same view, zero cost. We've walked past at sunset and the free viewpoint is almost as good.",
        "**Punta Carena lighthouse walk:** From Anacapri, walk 30 minutes downhill (or bus €2) to Punta Carena. Free lighthouse viewpoint, rocky swimming spots, and far fewer tourists. Bring snacks and water—it's remote. Walk back uphill takes 45 mins.",
        "**Via Krupp & Giardini di Augusto (€2 entry):** In Capri town, these gardens overlook the Faraglioni rocks. Via Krupp itself (the hairpin path down) is often closed, but the gardens are cheap and the view is the one you see in photos. Worth €2 if you have it."

        "**Pizza al taglio near Marina Grande:** There are 2-3 takeaway pizza spots within 100m of the ferry dock. €3-5 for a big slice. Not amazing, but it's fast and cheap. Eat at the benches by the port.",
        "**Anacapri side streets:** Walk 2-3 blocks off the main Anacapri square and you'll find small sandwich bars and focaccia shops. €5-8 for a filled focaccia and a drink. We've eaten at \"Bar Gabbiano\" (near the bus stop)—decent and half the price of the square.",
