### A2: Naming territory map

**1. Italian artisan provenance, without "atelier/maison"**
Opportunity: signal "made-with-care" and European taste through phonetics (soft vowels, clean consonants) rather than overused luxury words. Aligns with the competitive set where Italian brands combine craft cues with place names, but leaves room to avoid words like "atelier" or "maison" in the actual name.

**2. Urban promenade / café-terrazza world**
Opportunity: treat the walk as a "daily style ritual" (streets → park → espresso stop). Names should evoke movement, ease, and polish — not utility. This sits apart from competitor names anchored in product category language such as "dog" or functional accessories.

**3. Accessory-first fashion language**
Opportunity: position products like small leather goods (the way a mini bag or keychain charm is styled). Differentiates from competitors whose naming reads like pet gear ("Pet Company") or playful pet culture.

**4. Subtle companionship (no dog/pet cue in name)**
Opportunity: build a brand the owner can hold without signalling "pet product," supporting future expansion into owner-facing accessories and travel/grooming bags. Structurally rarer in the competitor list, which often foregrounds "dog/pet/animal."

**5. Warm feminine persona / founder-style label**
Opportunity: create a "person with taste" feeling — approachable premium, compliments-friendly, social-handle-friendly. White space exists for founder energy without casualness (not cute, not twee).

### A3: Landscape summary

The category is crowded with names that either (a) explicitly anchor to "dog/pet/animal," (b) use generic brand scaffolding ("Company," "& Co"), or (c) lean into pet-culture slang (e.g. "woof"), which tends to read more casual than the €60–€150 premium band.

A second cluster borrows credibility via geography ("London," "Milano"), a proven shortcut to "style," but one that can become non-ownable — especially when paired with descriptive category language.

White space for this positioning is clearest in **fashion-label-first naming**: short, elegant, vowel-friendly names that can sit on leather goods and jewellery-like charms without saying "dog," while still being pronounceable in English/Italian/French/Spanish. This also supports the key differentiator (premium craft at accessible-premium with a friendlier exchange policy) by signalling polish and trust rather than "pet novelty." Pagerie's narrow returns window and store-credit framing illustrates why a brand that feels welcoming and confident — not punitive — can win mindshare at the premium edge.

**Underserved territories:** Accessory-first fashion language and Subtle companionship are the most open; no current competitor clearly occupies either space.

### B2: Per-candidate detail blocks

---

### Vellara
Rationale: Vellara sounds like a small leather-goods label — soft vowels, clean consonants, and a premium "hand-feel" in the mouth. It avoids pet clichés while still feeling warm and curated, fitting an urban millennial customer who wants the walk to feel styled rather than utilitarian. It scales: it could sit on collar charms, travel pouches, grooming bags, or owner accessories without sounding anchored to one product.
Domain evidence: WHOIS not run; result: unknown — check required; prioritise vellara.com, then vellara.co / vellara.eu.

## D) Recommendation

**Recommended name: Vellara**

Vellara is the strongest fit for the "premium dog lifestyle accessories" positioning because it behaves like a fashion label first and a pet brand second — exactly the white space that emerges when examining the competitor landscape. Many competitors either foreground pet category language ("Dog/Pet/Animal"), lean casual/playful ("woof"), or rely on structural scaffolding such as "Company/& Co," which pulls perceived tone downmarket relative to the €60–€150 goal.

Vellara is short, vowel-friendly, and easy to place on leather goods, charms, travel pouches, grooming accessories, and eventually owner accessories — without sounding like a single-product brand. It supports the emotional and social job-to-be-done: the name feels "curated and confident," consistent with "I'm the dog mum who has it together."

Crucially, the sound and temperament of Vellara communicates trust and warmth rather than exclusivity-as-punishment. That matters because a core premium-category pain point is returns rigidity — Pagerie's narrow returns window and store-credit framing makes buyers feel stuck. The planned 30-day no-fault exchange becomes more believable under a name that feels welcoming, not severe. The invented quality of the word also means SERP noise risk is low — no competing dictionary meaning floods results — and the invented construction leaves room for trademark ownership across the product roadmap classes.

**Suggested tagline / brand descriptor:** *City-walk essentials, finished like jewellery.*

**Primary risk:** Trademark and handle/domain clearance is unverified (EUIPO and UKIPO search was blocked during research). Before committing, run manual clearance: EUIPO eSearch + UKIPO in classes 18/28/35/25/14; verify @vellara and @vellara.dog on Instagram and @vellara on TikTok; and secure vellara.com (or vellara.co / vellara.eu as fallback).

**Two alternatives if Vellara hits a blocker:** Lunera, Civana.
