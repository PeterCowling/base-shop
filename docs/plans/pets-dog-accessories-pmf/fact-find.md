# PETS — Dog Accessories Business Fact-Find

## Scope

### Summary

A new standalone dog accessories brand, completely separate from HBAG. First product:
a premium dog poop bag holder — the same mini Birkin-style bag body as HBAG, fitted
with a leash clip instead of a bag chain. Intent is a broader dog accessories line;
the poop bag holder is product 1 and the demand signal test.

Brand name is TBD — to be determined at the `/lp-offer` stage. The business unit
code is **PETS** (internal BOS identifier only, not the brand name). No crossover
with HBAG at launch: separate brand identity, separate ICP, separate channels.

Running in parallel with the HBAG demand test. Same physical supplier; different
hardware, branding, and go-to-market.

### Goals

- Confirm the premium dog holder price point (€60–€120) is achievable with the
  existing product body + leash clip hardware.
- Establish whether the same supplier can provide leash clip attachment hardware.
- Define the ICP and initial channel strategy clearly enough for `/lp-plan`.
- Set an outcome contract structure for the PETS business unit.
- Define product line vision so the brand name (from `/lp-offer`) has the right scope.

### Non-goals

- Designing or naming the brand (comes from `/lp-offer`).
- Building any app or website.
- Expanding beyond the holder to other dog products before first sale.
- Any crossover positioning with HBAG.

### Constraints & Assumptions

- Constraints:
  - Same single operator (Pete) running in parallel with HBAG — bandwidth is limited.
  - Brand name cannot be decided until `/lp-offer` runs.
  - Hardware change (leash clip) may require supplier confirmation — unverified.
  - Pagerie ($152) and LISH (£65) already own the luxury ceiling; PETS enters
    at premium (€60–€120), not ultra-luxury.
- Assumptions:
  - The existing mini bag body is adaptable to a leash clip without structural changes.
  - The dog holder ICP (urban millennial female dog owner) does not overlap with
    the HBAG ICP in purchase context, even if occasionally the same person.
  - Etsy and Instagram/TikTok dog communities are viable first-day channels.
  - No CE marking required for a leather/faux-leather adult dog accessory (unlike H5
    children's product — this is not a toy).

## Evidence Audit (Current State)

### Market Research (from HBAG session, 2026-02-17)

All market research below was conducted during the HBAG fact-find and applies
directly to the PETS dog holder product.

**Competitor landscape — full price ladder:**

| Tier | Brand | Price | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Budget | Earth Rated, generic | $5–$10 | Commodity, no fashion signal |
| Mid-fashion | Lucy & Co | $9.80–$14 | Neoprene coordinated "walk sets"; strong DTC brand |
| Mid-premium licensed | Sassy Woof | $12.99–$15.99 | Disney/Barbie/DC IP; Chewy, Petco, PetSmart, Amazon |
| Premium craft | Atlas Pet Company | $35–$45 | Recycled materials, lifetime warranty, handmade CO, Dyneema tier |
| Luxury leather | LISH London | £49–£65 | Vegetable-tanned Italian leather, British saddler, Liberty Print ltd ed |
| Ultra-luxury | Pagerie "The Pochette" | $152 | Full leather zipped pochette, 8 colorways — top of market |

**PETS target price:** €60–€120 — sits between Atlas ($45) and LISH (£65).
This is the genuine white space: premium craft quality, fashion-forward, without
the ultra-luxury price of Pagerie.

**Market size:**
- Dog poop bag holder market: $1.12B (2024) → $2.02B by 2033 at 6.7% CAGR
- Luxury pet accessories: $4.0B (2023) → $6.7B by 2033 at 5.3% CAGR
- Dogs: 55–60% of total pet accessories spend

**ICP evidence:**
- Primary buyer: urban millennial female dog owner who treats dog as lifestyle companion
- Proven by brand positioning across segment: Lucy & Co (coordinated "walk sets"),
  Pagerie (luxury pochette), LISH London (British saddler leather)
- Licensed IP brands (Sassy Woof: Barbie, Disney, DC) confirm: female buyers want
  fashion signal, not just function
- Gift-giver is a secondary buyer (dog birthday, new dog gift)
- Etsy: 5,000+ listings for "dog poop bag holder" — confirms active buyer intent

**Channel evidence:**
- Etsy: 5,000+ listings confirm active buyer intent; artisan premium ($25–$60)
  already selling at scale
- Instagram/TikTok: dog lifestyle content is a documented high-engagement vertical;
  hashtag volumes: #dogmom (10M+ posts), #dogaccessories (2M+ posts)
- Pet boutiques: B2B wholesale channel — later stage, post first-sale validation

### Delivery & Channel Landscape

- **Audience:** Urban female millennial dog owners, 25–40, treat dog as family
  member / lifestyle extension. Mobile-first buyers. Visual discovery (Instagram,
  TikTok, Pinterest). Strong community identity ("dog mum" culture).
- **Channel constraints:** Must be completely separate from HBAG channels.
  Different Instagram account, different Etsy shop, different brand handles.
- **Existing assets:** None. Brand, shop, account — all to be created.
- **Compliance:** No CE marking required for adult pet accessory (not a toy).
  Standard EU product labelling applies. Leather/faux-leather: no REACH issues
  at small volume. Verify with supplier.
- **Measurement hooks:** Weekly Etsy views/sales + Instagram DM inquiries.
  Separate demand log from HBAG.

### Hypothesis & Validation Landscape

#### Key Hypotheses

| # | Hypothesis | Falsification cost | Falsification time |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | Premium dog holder at €60–€120 finds buyers among fashion-conscious dog owners | Low (Etsy listing) | 2–4 weeks |
| H2 | Leash clip hardware is available from existing supplier without product redesign | Low (1 supplier email) | 3–5 days |
| H3 | "Dog mum" Instagram/TikTok community drives purchase intent faster than Etsy SEO | Low (2-week probe) | 2 weeks |
| H4 | PETS brand can build identity without HBAG association — zero crossover confusion | Medium (brand test) | Post-offer stage |

#### Existing Signal Coverage

| Hypothesis | Evidence | Source | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | Pagerie $152 proves ultra-luxury ceiling; LISH £65 proves premium leather buyer; Atlas $45 proves craft premium | HBAG research session | High |
| H2 | **Confirmed by Pete 2026-02-17** — leash clip fits existing bag body; no product redesign needed | Pete (direct) | High |
| H3 | #dogmom 10M+ Instagram posts; dog lifestyle is proven high-engagement vertical | HBAG research session | Medium |
| H4 | No brand exists yet — cannot test crossover confusion until brand is named | None | Not tested |

#### Recommended Validation Approach

1. **Immediate (before plan tasks begin):** Email supplier — does the mini bag body
   accept a leash clip attachment? If yes, PETS is viable without product development.
   If no, scope includes hardware R&D cycle.
2. **Weeks 1–2:** Photograph H1 (dog holder with leash clip, on a dog lead in use).
   Post to a new dedicated dog Instagram account — measure DM inquiries.
3. **Weeks 2–4:** Open separate Etsy shop (PETS brand TBD). List dog holder at €80.
   4-week demand test.
4. **Deferred:** Other dog products (collar hardware, lead accessories, travel bag)
   only after first 10 sales confirmed.

## Open Questions (User Input Needed)

- **Q1:** ~~Can the existing supplier fit a leash clip to the current bag body?~~
  - **Resolved 2026-02-17:** Yes — confirmed by Pete. Leash clip fits; no redesign needed.

- **Q2:** ~~What is the target price?~~
  - **Resolved 2026-02-17:** €80. Positions alongside LISH London (£65), well below
    Pagerie ($152). Clean premium anchor.

- **Q3:** ~~What other dog products are in scope?~~
  - **Resolved 2026-02-17:** Broad over time — full dog lifestyle accessories line
    (lead charms, collar accessories, travel pouches, grooming, apparel accessories).
    Holder is product 1 only. **Key implication for `/lp-offer`:** brand name must
    have broad lifestyle scope, not single-product utility (not "the holder brand" —
    more "the dog lifestyle brand"). Think Lucy & Co, not Pagerie.

- **Q4:** Distribution: online only at launch (default assumption applied — Pete
  did not override). Brikette channel deferred; no brand blur at launch.

---

## Confidence Inputs

- **Implementation:** 72%
  - H2 confirmed by Pete 2026-02-17 — leash clip fits existing bag body, no redesign.
    Main implementation blocker resolved. Raises to 80% when Q2 (price) and Q3
    (product line scope) are answered.
- **Approach:** 75%
  - Demand-first, separate brand, Etsy + Instagram sequence is identical to HBAG
    and is the right approach. Approach confidence is high.
- **Impact:** 70%
  - Market size and competitor landscape confirm the opportunity. Price gap between
    Atlas ($45) and LISH (£65) is real. Raises to 80% when first 10 Etsy views
    confirm buyer intent at target price.
- **Delivery-Readiness:** 25%
  - No brand, no product sample with leash clip, no account, no outcome contract.
    Raises to 60% when supplier confirms hardware + Q1–Q3 answered.

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~Supplier can't fit leash clip to existing bag body~~ | ~~Medium~~ | ~~High~~ | **Resolved 2026-02-17 — confirmed by Pete** |
| PETS and HBAG blur in customer perception despite separate brands | Low (at launch) | High | Enforce strict channel separation; no shared handles, imagery, or copy |
| Premium price (€80) undercut by Sassy Woof ($13) at scale | Low at premium tier | Low | Different ICP — premium buyer is not cross-shopping with licensed neoprene |
| Single operator bandwidth with two parallel demand tests | High | Medium | Stagger active tasks: HBAG photography first, PETS listing 1–2 weeks later |
| Dog holder market at premium ($60–$120) has low search volume on Etsy | Medium | Medium | Test with Etsy Ads (€15–€30) if organic views <20 in 14 days |

---

## Suggested Task Seeds (Non-binding)

1. **Supplier hardware check** — email supplier: can leash clip be fitted to existing
   bag body? What is the additional cost per unit?
2. **Answer Q1–Q4** — owner Pete.
3. **Write PETS outcome contract** — separate from HBAG-OUT-2026Q1-01.
4. **Run `/lp-offer` for PETS** — produces brand name, ICP lock, and pricing.
5. **Create PETS Etsy shop** — separate from any HBAG shop, brand TBD.
6. **Dog holder photography** — reuse TASK-06 shoot format; add leash clip shot.
7. **Instagram/TikTok account for PETS** — separate handle, dog lifestyle content.
8. **4-week demand test** — staggered 1–2 weeks after HBAG demand test launches.

---

## Execution Routing Packet

- Primary execution skill: `lp-offer` — brand name and ICP must come before plan
  execution. Run `/lp-offer` as TASK-01 of the PETS plan.
- Supporting skills: `lp-channels`, `lp-forecast`, `biz-product-brief`
- Deliverable acceptance: supplier hardware confirmed + outcome contract written +
  brand name from `/lp-offer` + Etsy shop live.
- Post-delivery measurement: weekly Etsy views/sales + Instagram DM inquiries
  in separate `docs/plans/pets-dog-accessories-pmf/demand-log.md`.

---

## Evidence Gap Review

### Gaps Addressed

- Competitor landscape fully mapped across all price tiers (budget to ultra-luxury).
- Market size confirmed: $1.12B dog holder market, $4B luxury pet accessories.
- ICP confirmed by brand-level evidence: Lucy & Co, Pagerie, LISH London all
  target the same urban female millennial dog owner.
- Price gap confirmed: €60–€120 is a real white space between Atlas ($45) and
  LISH (£65).
- Channel evidence: Etsy 5,000+ listings + dog lifestyle Instagram volumes confirmed.

### Confidence Adjustments

- Implementation held at 50% — supplier hardware (H2) is the only hard blocker
  and is completely uninvestigated.
- Delivery-Readiness held at 25% — no brand, no product sample, no account.
- These are not oversights; they are the correct gating conditions.

### Remaining Assumptions

- Leash clip can be fitted to existing bag body without structural redesign — **unverified**.
- Premium dog owner ICP will pay €80 for an artisan leather-look holder from an
  unknown brand — **plausible from competitor data, unproven for this specific product**.
- PETS and HBAG will not blur in customer perception at launch — **depends on strict
  channel and visual separation, which is a practice discipline not a product feature**.

## Planning Readiness

- Status: **Ready-for-planning**
- Blocking items:
  - Q1 (supplier hardware) is soft-blocking PETS photography and listing tasks.
    Plan should include a supplier check as TASK-01 or prerequisite.
  - Brand name blocked until `/lp-offer` — TASK-01 of the plan should be
    running `/lp-offer`.
- Recommended next step:
  - `/lp-plan pets-dog-accessories-pmf`
  - Resolve Q1 (supplier hardware) in parallel.
