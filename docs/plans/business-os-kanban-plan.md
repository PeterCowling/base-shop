# Business OS + Kanban System Plan

## Summary

Implement a repo-native Business OS + Kanban system that coordinates human and agent work across all business functions (engineering, ops, marketing, finance, supply chain, property, partnerships, hiring, legal). The system provides:
1. A Next.js Kanban app (`apps/business-os`) that reads/writes repo artifacts
2. Extended agent discipline covering Ideas → Fact-find → Plan → Build/Do → Reflect for non-coding work
3. Repo-native documentation layer (business plans + people) tied to kanban execution

The system is ERP-like in breadth but not implementation—UI must be extremely user-friendly while agent machinery stays in-repo. All artifacts live under `docs/business-os/` with dual human/agent markdown formats.

## Goals

- Create single coordinated system for opportunity management across all businesses (existing + new)
- Enable humans and agents to generate, work up, fact-find, plan, execute, and reflect on ideas/opportunities
- Provide evidence-gated, risk-managed workflow for non-coding work matching engineering rigor
- Make business plans, people responsibilities, and execution status visible and queryable in-repo
- Support progressive elaboration: raw ideas → worked ideas → cards → staged execution → reflection → plan updates

## Non-goals

- Phase 0 does NOT include: agent APIs, multi-agent runners, PR-based review workflow, public access
- NOT replacing the existing dashboard workboard (separate scope/naming to prevent confusion)
- NOT building ERP-style complexity—this is intentionally lightweight and repo-backed
- NOT implementing agent ownership in Phase 0 (human ownership only)
- NOT implementing manual card ordering (always computed by priority/due/updated/created)
- NOT special-casing PLAT business (treated like any other business code)

## Constraints & Assumptions

- Constraints:
  - Single agent runner: only Pete can run agents in Phase 0
  - No agent APIs: app must not call agents; Pete runs prompts manually
  - **Repo write model (✅ RESOLVED via BOS-00-B):** Governance exception granted. App commits to `work/business-os-*` branches → existing auto-PR workflow creates PR → auto-merge after CI passes. Preserves audit trail and rollback capability while enabling automated writes.
  - Path-level authorization: strict allowlist enforced server-side
  - Plan/people editing: only Pete and agents may edit business plans and people docs
  - Lane move proposals: only Pete and agents may propose lane moves
  - Archive policy: Dropped/Retired items MUST move to archive/ and be hidden from UI
  - Taxonomy alignment: Option A required in Phase 0 (Business OS docs in docs:lint + registry)
  - Lane transition stage docs: Option 2 (always-on) required
- Assumptions:
  - Existing `@acme/design-system` and `@acme/ui` provide sufficient primitives for Kanban UI
  - Git conflicts will be minimized via append-only comment logs and atomic file operations
  - Business catalog starts small (BRIK, SKYL, PLAT) and grows incrementally

## Fact-Find Reference

- Related brief: N/A (derived from comprehensive requirements doc `repo-native-business-os-kanban-system-prompt.md`)
- Key findings:
  - Existing dashboard workboard at `apps/dashboard/src/pages/workboard.tsx` is CMS-fed and unrelated to our kanban (naming conflict risk mitigated by separate app)
  - Repo already has strong docs infrastructure: `docs/registry.json`, `pnpm docs:lint`, `docs/AGENTS.docs.md`
  - Repo uses Turborepo + pnpm workspaces; conventions are `@apps/<app>` and `@acme/<pkg>`
  - Quality gates: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/testing-policy.md`, `scripts/validate-changes.sh` already standardized
  - Agent workflows: `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` extensible pattern exists

## Existing System Notes

- Key modules/files:
  - `docs/AGENTS.docs.md` — doc taxonomy, Plan format conventions, registry system
  - `docs/registry.json` — generated by `pnpm docs:lint`; powers doc tooling
  - `apps/dashboard/src/pages/workboard.tsx` — existing CMS workboard (different scope; avoid naming collision)
  - `packages/ui/` and `packages/design-system/` — reusable UI components (design tokens, atoms, molecules)
  - `scripts/validate-changes.sh` — typecheck + lint + targeted tests gate
- Patterns to follow:
  - Dual-audience docs: many repos use `.user.md` / `.agent.md` or similar for LLM vs human optimization
  - Frontmatter validation: existing `pnpm docs:lint` already validates required fields
  - Append-only comment logs: reduces git conflicts in collaborative edits
  - Feature flags: repo has examples (check `packages/platform-core` for toggles pattern)

## Proposed Approach

### Architecture overview

- **Storage layer:** All canonical state lives in `docs/business-os/` as markdown + JSON
  - Ideas: `ideas/inbox/` (raw) and `ideas/worked/` (with cards)
  - Cards: `cards/<ID>.user.md` + `cards/<ID>.agent.md` + `cards/<ID>/<stage>.(user|agent).md`
  - Boards: derived views stored as `boards/<BIZ>.board.json` and `boards/global.board.json`
  - Strategy: `strategy/businesses.json` (business catalog) + `strategy/<BIZ>/plan.(user|agent).md`
  - People: `people/people.(user|agent).md`
  - Scans: `scans/last-scan.json`, `scans/active-docs.json`, `scans/history/`
- **App layer:** Next.js 15 / React 19 app at `apps/business-os`
  - Server actions for repo writes (direct git commits to `main`)
  - Path-level authorization enforced server-side
  - Renders only `.user.md` files (agent files not shown in UI)
- **Agent layer:** Extends existing `.claude/skills/` pattern
  - New skills: `/work-idea`, `/propose-lane-move`, `/scan-repo`, `/update-business-plan`, `/update-people`
  - Reuses existing `/fact-find`, `/plan-feature`, `/build-feature`, `/reflect` for engineering cards
  - All agent runs are Pete-triggered in Phase 0; outputs commit to repo

### Data flow

1. User submits raw idea → `docs/business-os/ideas/inbox/<ID>.user.md` created
2. Agent works up idea → `ideas/worked/<ID>.user.md` + card created in `cards/<ID>.user.md`
3. Card progresses through lanes → stage docs (`fact-find.md`, `plan.md`, `build.md`, `reflect.md`) maintained
4. Lane moves proposed via `Proposed-Lane` frontmatter field → Pete/agent approves → lane updated
5. Reflection output updates business plans and people docs
6. Archive: Dropped/Retired items moved to `archive/` subdirectories; hidden from UI

### Alternatives considered

- **Option A (chosen):** Repo-native storage with direct git commits
  - Pros: Simple, auditable, works offline, git history = audit trail, no DB setup
  - Cons: Concurrent writes need conflict handling, performance limits at scale (acceptable for Phase 0)
- **Option B (deferred):** Hybrid DB + git (DB for cards/ideas, git for plans/people)
  - Pros: Better concurrency, faster queries, real-time updates
  - Cons: Complexity, dual source of truth, requires DB setup/hosting
  - Why deferred: Phase 0 scope + single agent runner means repo-native is sufficient; migrate if scaling issues arise

## Tasks

### BOS-00-A: Determine deployment runtime and git access model

- **Type:** DECISION
- **Affects:** Deployment architecture, BOS-10 implementation approach
- **Depends on:** -
- **Status:** Needs-Input
- **Confidence:** 40% ⚠️ BLOCKER
  - Implementation: 40% — User indicated "hosted with local testing" but critical mechanism unproven: Vercel/Cloudflare don't provide writable git checkouts by default
  - Approach: 40% — "Filesystem access in hosted mode" is an unproven assumption; standard serverless deployments are read-only
  - Impact: 40% — Without proven writable checkout mechanism, BOS-10 cannot be implemented as designed

#### Partial Decision (2026-01-28) - INCOMPLETE
- **User input:** "Hosted, with local testing i.e. dev/localhost"
- **Interpreted as:** Phase 0 local-only, migrate to hosted later
- **Unresolved critical questions:**
  - **Q1:** How does hosted deployment get writable git checkout? (Vercel/CF Pages are read-only by default)
  - **Q2:** Where does git push go in hosted mode? (GitHub API? SSH to remote git server?)
  - **Q3:** Who manages deploy keys/credentials in hosted mode?
  - **Q4:** What's the concurrency model in hosted mode? (Multiple instances? Single writer lock?)

- **Provisional Phase 0 approach (local-only until hosted mechanism proven):**
  - **Phase 0 (immediate):** Local development on Pete's machine (`pnpm --filter @apps/business-os dev`)
  - **Git access:** Direct filesystem (Pete's local repo)
  - **Credentials:** Pete's existing git config
  - **Concurrency:** None (single user, single process)
  - **Deployment:** Not deployed; local-only

- **Phase 1+ blocked until resolved:**
  - Cannot migrate to hosted deployment without proven writable checkout mechanism
  - Options to investigate:
    - **Option A:** Self-hosted on VM with git checkout (not serverless)
    - **Option B:** GitHub API commits (no local git; different from BOS-18 choice)
    - **Option C:** Serverless function triggers separate worker with checkout (complex)
    - **Option D:** Keep local-only permanently (Pete's machine is the deployment)

- **Options (evaluated):**
  - **Option A: Local-only (Pete's machine)**
    - Pros: Direct filesystem access, no auth complexity, full git CLI available
    - Cons: Not accessible to other users, single point of failure, no redundancy
    - Trade-offs: Simplest for Phase 0; limits multi-user testing
  - **Option B: Hosted service with checked-out repo**
    - Pros: Multi-user access, standard web app deployment
    - Cons: Requires persistent writable checkout, complex credential management, concurrency/locking needed
    - Trade-offs: Most flexible; highest complexity for Phase 0
  - **Option C: GitHub API commits (no local repo)**
    - Pros: No writable checkout needed, GitHub handles concurrency
    - Cons: Different API from BOS-18 (isomorphic-git), rate limits, requires GitHub token management
    - Trade-offs: Clean separation; different implementation from planned approach
- **Acceptance (to reach 80%+ confidence):**
  - [ ] Hosted deployment mechanism proven (writable checkout OR GitHub API OR self-hosted VM)
  - [ ] Credentials management strategy defined for hosted mode
  - [ ] Concurrency model defined for hosted mode (if multi-instance)
  - [x] Phase 0 local-only approach defined (complete; 100% for Phase 0 only)
  - [ ] BOS-10 updated with Phase 1+ constraints (blocked until hosted mechanism resolved)
  - [ ] BOS-00-F updated with runtime choice (Node vs Edge)
- **Impact on other tasks:**
  - **BOS-10 (Blocked):** Cannot design git write operations without knowing access model
  - **BOS-18:** May need to revisit if GitHub API chosen (octokit instead of isomorphic-git)
  - **BOS-27:** Commit identity approach depends on runtime
  - **BOS-29:** E2E test environment depends on runtime
- **Notes / references:**
  - Repo precedent: CLI git via execSync in `deploy.ts:28-39` (local execution model)
  - Requirements line 46: "App commits directly to main with no PR step"
  - Conflict with `AGENTS.md:55`: "never commit to main" (addressed in BOS-00-B)

### BOS-00-B: Reconcile direct-to-main commits with repo governance

- **Type:** DECISION
- **Affects:** Git workflow, branch protection, repo safety
- **Depends on:** BOS-00-A (runtime determines feasibility of options)
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Confidence:** 100%
  - Implementation: 100% — Decision made; existing auto-PR workflow provides safety mechanism
  - Approach: 100% — Governance exception granted; leverages existing repo infrastructure
  - Impact: 100% — Known pattern; preserves audit trail and rollback capability
- **Decision:** **Governance exception granted for Business OS app**
  - User decision: "An exception needs to be made for this app"
  - **Mechanism:** Use existing auto-PR workflow (`.github/workflows/auto-pr.yml`)
    - App commits to `work/business-os-*` branches (following repo convention)
    - Auto-PR workflow creates PR automatically from work/* branches (lines 19-58)
    - PR includes "Auto-merge is enabled when checks pass" (lines 42-47)
    - "zero-touch" label added automatically (lines 59-94)
    - Auto-merge enabled with SQUASH method (lines 95-126)
  - **Rationale:**
    - Preserves PR audit trail (all commits visible in PR history)
    - Maintains rollback capability (revert PR if needed)
    - Aligns with repo governance philosophy (changes reviewed by CI, not human)
    - Provides safety via validation gates (typecheck/lint/tests run before merge)
    - Leverages existing infrastructure (no new bot/service account needed)
  - **Trade-off accepted:** Slight delay (merge time after CI passes) vs true direct-to-main
  - **Rollback procedure:** Revert PR via GitHub UI or `git revert` + PR
  - **Authority:** Exception approved by Pete (repo owner) for Business OS app only
- **Implementation guidance for BOS-10:**
  - Commits must target `work/business-os-<timestamp>` branches
  - Commit message must include context for PR body (will be visible in auto-PR)
  - Wait for auto-merge completion before returning success to UI
  - Handle merge failures gracefully (CI failures, conflicts)
- **Impact on other tasks:**
  - **BOS-10 (Unblocked):** Use work/* branch + auto-PR workflow pattern
  - **BOS-27:** Commit identity uses real user name/email (no service account needed)
- **Notes / references:**
  - `.github/workflows/auto-pr.yml` (lines 19-126): existing auto-PR + auto-merge workflow
  - `AGENTS.md:55`: "NEVER commit to main directly" — exception granted for Business OS via auto-PR safety mechanism
  - Requirements line 76: "reconcile governance explicitly" — resolved via existing repo infrastructure

### BOS-00-C: Design docs registry sync on app writes

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `apps/business-os/src/lib/repo/registry-sync.ts`, BOS-10 write operations
- **Depends on:** BOS-07 (docs:lint extension defines Business OS types in registry)
- **Confidence:** 60%
  - Implementation: 65% — Registry generation logic understood (`docs-lint.ts:86-101`); sync mechanism straightforward
  - Approach: 60% — Two approaches: (1) call `pnpm docs:lint` after write, (2) replicate registry logic in app; choice affects performance
  - Impact: 55% — Stale registry breaks Option A "docs taxonomy alignment"; queries return incomplete results
- **Problem statement:**
  - BOS-07 extends docs:lint to include Business OS docs in `docs/registry.json`
  - App writes new docs to `docs/business-os/` (BOS-10)
  - Registry is generated by `pnpm docs:lint` (currently manual invocation)
  - **Gap:** After app writes, registry is stale until `pnpm docs:lint` runs
  - **Impact:** App queries may return incomplete results; registry-dependent features break
- **Options:**
  - **Option A: Run `pnpm docs:lint` after every write (via BOS-10)**
    - Mechanism: After git commit, execute `pnpm docs:lint` via child_process.execSync
    - Pros: Reuses existing validation logic, registry always in sync
    - Cons: ~1-2s per write (slow for users), requires pnpm in PATH
    - Trade-offs: Simple, reliable; performance acceptable for Phase 0 write frequency (<10/day)
  - **Option B: Replicate registry logic in app (incremental update)**
    - Mechanism: App parses frontmatter of written doc, appends to `docs/registry.json` directly
    - Pros: Fast (<50ms), no external dependency
    - Cons: Duplicates logic (maintenance burden), could drift from docs:lint behavior
    - Trade-offs: Performance; code duplication risk
  - **Option C: Registry sync as background job (eventual consistency)**
    - Mechanism: App writes docs; separate cron/watch process runs `pnpm docs:lint` every 5 min
    - Pros: Decouples write from registry update, no user-facing delay
    - Cons: Registry can be stale for up to 5 min, adds background process complexity
    - Trade-offs: Eventual consistency; acceptable for Phase 0 (low write frequency)
- **Recommendation:** Option A for Phase 0 (simplicity > performance at low scale)
- **Acceptance:**
  - Registry sync mechanism chosen and documented
  - BOS-10 updated to include registry sync in write operations
  - Test: Write a card, verify `docs/registry.json` includes new entry
  - Performance: Registry sync completes in <5s per write (acceptable for Phase 0)
- **Test plan:**
  - Integration: Write idea → verify registry.json updated
  - Integration: Write card → verify registry.json updated
  - Integration: Archive card → verify registry.json removes entry (or marks archived)
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Integrated into BOS-10 write operations
  - Rollback: If registry sync fails, write still succeeds (registry can be manually regenerated via `pnpm docs:lint`)
- **Notes / references:**
  - Registry generation: `docs-lint.ts:86-101`
  - Registry schema: `{path, type, status, domain}[]`
  - Option A complete = BOS-07 incomplete acknowledged by user

### BOS-00-D: Auth identity implementation (Pete vs non-Pete)

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `apps/business-os/src/lib/auth/identity.ts`, middleware
- **Depends on:** BOS-00-E (auth mechanism choice)
- **Status:** Pending (blocked by BOS-00-E)
- **Confidence:** 50% ⚠️
  - Implementation: 55% — Identity check logic straightforward BUT depends on auth mechanism from BOS-00-E
  - Approach: 50% — Cannot design identity implementation without knowing if NextAuth, custom auth, or no-auth (local-only)
  - Impact: 45% — Incorrect identity allows privilege escalation; blocked by upstream decision
- **Problem statement:**
  - BOS-09 enforces path-level authorization: "Pete + agents" vs "non-Pete users"
  - Requirements: "only Pete and agents may edit business plans and people docs"
  - **Gap:** No definition of how to identify "Pete" vs spoofing prevention
  - **Risk:** User could impersonate Pete or agent to bypass authorization
- **Existing repo patterns:**
  - `middleware.ts:5`: Likely NextAuth-based auth (need to verify)
  - `middleware.ts:10`: Auth check pattern (need to verify)
  - Assumption: Repo has user identity from auth session
- **Approach:**
  - **Identity check:** `user.id === PETE_USER_ID || user.role === 'agent'`
  - **Pete identity:** Hardcoded user ID or email from env var (`PETE_USER_ID` / `PETE_EMAIL`)
  - **Agent identity:** Special role or separate auth token for agent skills
  - **Spoofing prevention:** Identity comes from server-side session (not client-provided header)
- **Acceptance:**
  - Function `isPeteOrAgent(user)` returns boolean
  - Pete identity defined via env var or hardcoded constant (document which)
  - Agent identity mechanism defined (role-based or token-based)
  - Unit tests: Pete identified correctly, non-Pete rejected, agent identified correctly
  - Integration: Non-Pete user attempts to write plan → 403 Forbidden
- **Test plan:**
  - Unit: `apps/business-os/src/lib/auth/identity.test.ts`
  - Integration: Auth check in BOS-09 authorization middleware
- **What would make this ≥80%:**
  - Verify existing auth mechanism (NextAuth? Custom?)
  - Clarify agent auth strategy (how does agent skill authenticate?)
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Integrated into BOS-09 authorization middleware
  - Rollback: Remove identity check (allow all writes; unsafe but reversible)
- **Documentation impact:**
  - `docs/business-os/security.md` document identity mechanism and Pete configuration
- **Notes / references:**
  - Requirements lines 318-325: "Commit authorship: real user identity or agent identity"
  - Requirements lines 330-342: "Path-level authorization: only Pete/agents may modify plans/people"
  - Existing patterns: `middleware.ts:5`, `:10` (need verification)

### BOS-00-E: Choose auth mechanism for apps/business-os

- **Type:** DECISION
- **Affects:** App architecture, auth implementation, BOS-00-D design
- **Depends on:** -
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Confidence:** 100%
  - Implementation: 100% — Decision made; no auth implementation needed for Phase 0
  - Approach: 100% — Local-only trust model is simplest and sufficient for single-user Phase 0
  - Impact: 100% — Known trade-off; migration to full auth required for Phase 1+ hosted deployment
- **Decision:** **Option A: No auth (local-only trust model)**
  - User decision: "No auth for p0"
  - **Mechanism:** App assumes single trusted user (Pete); no login or session management required
  - **Rationale:**
    - Phase 0 is local-only (runs on Pete's machine)
    - Single user context eliminates need for authentication
    - Minimizes complexity for initial implementation
    - Allows focus on core kanban/docs functionality
  - **Trade-offs accepted:**
    - Cannot test multi-user scenarios in Phase 0
    - Must refactor for Phase 1+ when hosted deployment or multi-user access required
    - No protection against accidental local access (acceptable for dev/local use)
  - **Migration path to Phase 1+:**
    - Implement full authentication (Option B: integrate with existing repo auth patterns)
    - Add session management and authorization checks
    - Update BOS-00-D identity checks to use real user identity from auth session
    - Update BOS-09 authorization to enforce per-user permissions
- **Implementation guidance:**
  - **BOS-00-D (identity checks):** Hardcode identity as "Pete" for Phase 0
    - `const currentUser = { name: "Pete", email: "pete@example.com", isPete: true }`
    - All "only Pete can..." checks use `currentUser.isPete === true`
  - **BOS-09 (authorization):** Implement permission checks with hardcoded Pete identity
    - Path-level authorization still enforced (only Pete/agents can edit plans/people)
    - Comment append permissions still differentiated (non-Pete can comment only)
    - Phase 1+ migration: replace hardcoded identity with session-based identity
  - **UI:** No login screen, no logout, no user profile
  - **Security note:** Phase 0 app must NOT be deployed to public URL (local-only)
- **Impact on other tasks:**
  - **BOS-00-D (Unblocked):** Use hardcoded Pete identity for Phase 0
  - **BOS-09 (Unblocked):** Implement authorization with trust model (no auth session required)
- **Notes / references:**
  - Phase 0 constraint: "Single agent runner: only Pete can run agents" (requirements line 76)
  - Phase 1+ migration: Investigate `middleware.ts` auth patterns when implementing full auth

### BOS-00-F: Node vs Edge runtime for git/filesystem routes

- **Type:** DECISION
- **Affects:** Next.js route config, API implementation, BOS-10 feasibility
- **Depends on:** BOS-00-A (deployment model affects runtime constraints)
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Confidence:** 100%
  - Implementation: 100% — Decision made; Node runtime required and supported by repo patterns
  - Approach: 100% — Follows established repo patterns for complex operations
  - Impact: 100% — Enables BOS-10 as designed; no refactor needed
- **Decision:** **Option A: Node runtime for all git/filesystem routes**
  - **Mechanism:** Add `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` to all Business OS API routes that touch git/filesystem
  - **Rationale:**
    - BOS-10 requires `fs` (read/write docs), `isomorphic-git` (git operations), and `child_process` (for `pnpm docs:lint`)
    - **All unavailable in Edge runtime** (Edge has no `fs`, `child_process`, or local filesystem access)
    - **Repo precedent:** Existing routes use Node runtime for complex operations:
      - `apps/cms/src/app/api/cart/route.ts:10` — `export const runtime = "nodejs"`
      - `apps/cms/src/app/api/media/route.ts:12` — `export const runtime = "nodejs"`
      - `apps/brikette/src/app/api/guides/bulk-translation-status/route.ts:10` — `export const runtime = "nodejs"`
    - Edge runtime used only for simple queries (`apps/product-pipeline` — database reads only)
  - **Trade-offs accepted:**
    - Cannot leverage Vercel Edge features (global distribution, cold start optimization)
    - Route handlers have longer cold starts than Edge functions
    - Acceptable for Phase 0 local-only deployment; can revisit for Phase 1+ hosted if needed
  - **Alternative rejected:** Option B (Edge runtime with GitHub API) would require:
    - Reversal of BOS-18 decision (isomorphic-git → octokit)
    - Full BOS-10 redesign (different concurrency model, no local fs)
    - Higher complexity and cost for Phase 0
- **Implementation guidance for BOS-10 and related tasks:**
  - Add to all git/filesystem API routes:
    ```typescript
    export const runtime = 'nodejs';
    ```
  - Routes requiring Node runtime:
    - `POST /api/business-os/cards` (create/update cards via fs)
    - `POST /api/business-os/ideas` (create ideas via fs)
    - `POST /api/business-os/commit` (git operations via isomorphic-git)
    - `POST /api/business-os/sync-registry` (run `pnpm docs:lint` via child_process)
  - Read-only routes (GET) can use Edge if desired, but simpler to use Node uniformly
- **Impact on other tasks:**
  - **BOS-10 (Unblocked):** Proceed with Node runtime; no refactor needed
  - **BOS-00-C (Unblocked):** `pnpm docs:lint` via child_process is viable
  - **BOS-18:** Confirmed isomorphic-git (Option A) aligns with Node runtime
- **Notes / references:**
  - Next.js runtime docs: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes
  - Repo pattern: Node for cart/media/guides; Edge for simple product-pipeline queries
  - BOS-10 design: assumes `fs`, `isomorphic-git`, `child_process` (all Node-only)

### BOS-01: Extend docs taxonomy for Business OS types

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `docs/AGENTS.docs.md`
- **Depends on:** -
- **Confidence:** 88%
  - Implementation: 90% — Existing taxonomy section is clear; adding new doc types is straightforward extension
  - Approach: 88% — Dual-audience pattern (`.user.md` / `.agent.md`) is consistent with repo philosophy
  - Impact: 85% — Changes isolated to doc type definitions; no breaking changes to existing types
- **Acceptance:**
  - `docs/AGENTS.docs.md` includes new Business OS doc types:
    - **Top-level:** Idea, Card, Board, Business-Plan, People
    - **Stage docs (always-on per BOS-19):** Fact-Find, Plan-Stage, Build-Log, Reflection
  - Each type has required frontmatter fields documented
  - Dual-audience convention (`.user.md` / `.agent.md`) is explicit
  - Evidence source typing enum is documented
  - **Semantic separation:** Document `Status:` (doc lifecycle: Draft/Active/etc.) vs `Idea-State:` / `Card-State:` / `Lane:` (workflow state) to avoid overloading Status field
- **Test plan:**
  - Manual: Review updated taxonomy section for completeness
  - Run: `pnpm docs:lint` to ensure no syntax errors in AGENTS.docs.md
- **Planning validation:**
  - Tests run: `git diff docs/AGENTS.docs.md` (current file read; no tests for markdown docs)
  - Test stubs written: N/A (S effort)
  - Unexpected findings: None
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - Example frontmatter blocks for each new doc type (reduces ambiguity during implementation)
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Direct commit; no feature flag needed (doc changes only)
  - Rollback: Git revert; no runtime impact
- **Documentation impact:**
  - Primary: `docs/AGENTS.docs.md` (this task)
  - Secondary: Update `docs/index.md` to reference Business OS taxonomy
- **Notes / references:**
  - Follow pattern from existing doc types (Charter, Contract, Plan, Research) at lines 100-262

### BOS-02: Create canonical storage structure

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `docs/business-os/` (new directory tree)
- **Depends on:** BOS-01
- **Confidence:** 90%
  - Implementation: 92% — Directory creation is trivial; `.gitkeep` files ensure structure persists
  - Approach: 90% — Storage structure is well-defined in requirements; matches repo conventions
  - Impact: 88% — New directories; no existing code affected
- **Acceptance:**
  - Directory structure matches spec: `docs/business-os/{strategy,people,ideas,cards,boards,scans}/`
  - Subdirectories: `ideas/{inbox,worked}`, `cards/<placeholder>`, `scans/history/`, each with `archive/`
  - Each directory contains `.gitkeep` or `README.md` explaining purpose
- **Test plan:**
  - Manual: `ls -R docs/business-os/` verifies structure
  - Run: `git status` confirms directories tracked
- **Planning validation:**
  - Tests run: N/A (directory creation; no executable tests)
  - Test stubs written: N/A (S effort)
  - Unexpected findings: None
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Direct commit; add empty directories with `.gitkeep`
  - Rollback: Git revert (removes empty directories)
- **Documentation impact:**
  - Add `docs/business-os/README.md` explaining structure and conventions
- **Notes / references:**
  - Storage structure specified in original requirements doc lines 95-139

### BOS-03: Create business catalog schema and initial data

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `docs/business-os/strategy/businesses.json`, TypeScript types
- **Depends on:** BOS-02
- **Confidence:** 85%
  - Implementation: 88% — JSON schema straightforward; TypeScript types follow repo patterns
  - Approach: 85% — Schema design is clear but may need adjustment as businesses added
  - Impact: 82% — New file; future changes require schema migration strategy
- **Acceptance:**
  - `businesses.json` exists with schema including: code, name, description, apps, packages, defaultOwners, active, archived
  - Initial data: BRIK, SKYL, PLAT businesses
  - TypeScript types in `apps/business-os/src/types/business.ts`
  - Zod schema for validation
- **Test plan:**
  - Unit: Validate businesses.json against Zod schema
  - Run: `pnpm test apps/business-os/src/types/business.test.ts`
- **Planning validation:**
  - Tests run: N/A (new code; no existing tests)
  - Test stubs written: N/A (S effort)
  - Unexpected findings: None
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - User confirmation of initial business list and required metadata fields
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Direct commit; app reads from JSON file
  - Rollback: Git revert (data-only change)
- **Documentation impact:**
  - Add schema documentation in `docs/business-os/strategy/README.md`
- **Notes / references:**
  - Requirements lines 172-198 specify business catalog structure
  - Follow Zod validation pattern from `packages/platform-core/src/validation/`

### BOS-04: Scaffold `apps/business-os` Next.js app

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `apps/business-os/` (new app), `turbo.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
- **Depends on:** -
- **Confidence:** 92%
  - Implementation: 95% — Next.js 15 app creation is standard; repo has multiple examples
  - Approach: 92% — App Router pattern matches existing apps; design system integration proven
  - Impact: 88% — New app; no changes to existing apps
- **Acceptance:**
  - App created: `apps/business-os` with Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind 4
  - Package name: `@apps/business-os` in `package.json`
  - Dependencies: `@acme/design-system`, `@acme/ui`, `zod`, `react-hook-form`
  - Turbo.json and pnpm-workspace.yaml updated
  - Dev server runs: `pnpm --filter @apps/business-os dev`
  - Root page renders placeholder "Business OS"
- **Test plan:**
  - Manual: `pnpm --filter @apps/business-os dev` and visit localhost
  - Run: `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint` (no errors in new app)
- **Planning validation:**
  - Tests run: N/A (app does not exist yet; will validate after scaffolding)
  - Test stubs written: N/A (M effort, but scaffolding doesn't need stubs)
  - Unexpected findings: None
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Direct commit; app not deployed yet (local dev only)
  - Rollback: Git revert (isolated app; no runtime dependencies)
- **Documentation impact:**
  - Add `apps/business-os/README.md` with setup instructions
- **Notes / references:**
  - Follow app structure from `apps/brikette` or `apps/cms`
  - Use `npx create-next-app@latest` with App Router + TypeScript flags

### BOS-05: Implement ID generation utility

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `apps/business-os/src/lib/id-generator.ts`, tests
- **Depends on:** BOS-03
- **Confidence:** 88%
  - Implementation: 90% — Simple counter logic; read highest existing ID and increment
  - Approach: 88% — ID format `<BIZ>-OPP-####` is clear; collision risk low with single writer
  - Impact: 85% — Utility function; no existing code affected
- **Acceptance:**
  - Function `generateId(businessCode: string)` returns `<BIZ>-OPP-####` format
  - Reads existing IDs from `docs/business-os/ideas/` and `docs/business-os/cards/` to find max
  - Zero-pads to 4 digits
  - Unit tests cover: first ID (`BRIK-OPP-0001`), incrementing, multiple businesses
- **Test plan:**
  - Unit: `apps/business-os/src/lib/id-generator.test.ts`
  - Run: `pnpm --filter @apps/business-os test id-generator`
- **Planning validation:**
  - Tests run: N/A (new code; no existing tests)
  - Test stubs written: N/A (S effort)
  - Unexpected findings: None
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - Concurrency test (simulate two rapid ID generations; verify no collision)
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Used by idea submission form; no runtime toggle needed
  - Rollback: Git revert (utility function; no persisted IDs yet)
- **Documentation impact:**
  - None (internal utility; JSDoc comments sufficient)
- **Notes / references:**
  - ID format requirements lines 195-201

### BOS-06: Audit existing `pnpm docs:lint` implementation

- **Type:** INVESTIGATE
- **Affects:** `scripts/src/docs-lint.ts`, `scripts/src/docs-registry.ts`
- **Depends on:** BOS-01
- **Status:** Complete (2026-01-28)
- **Confidence:** 100%
  - Implementation: 100% — Implementation located and fully understood
  - Approach: 100% — Clear extension path identified
  - Impact: 100% — Extension mechanism safe; no breaking changes needed

#### Re-plan Update (2026-01-28)
- **Previous confidence:** 65%
- **Updated confidence:** 100%
  - Implementation: 100% — Found at `scripts/src/docs-lint.ts`; simple line-based header parser (lines 69-84)
  - Approach: 100% — Extension via type-specific validation blocks (lines 129-142 show Charter/Contract pattern)
  - Impact: 100% — Registry generation is additive (lines 86-101); new types auto-included when Type header present
- **Investigation performed:**
  - Repo: `scripts/src/docs-lint.ts` (158 lines, walks `docs/`, parses frontmatter, validates, builds registry)
  - Repo: `scripts/src/docs-registry.ts` (105 lines, loads registry, query helpers by domain/type)
  - Script command: `package.json` line `"docs:lint": "node --import tsx scripts/src/docs-lint.ts"`
  - Tests: No existing test files found (gap noted)
- **Decision / resolution:**
  - **Architecture:** Single-file script; walks `docs/**/*.md`, parses first 40 lines for headers, validates per-type rules, writes `docs/registry.json`
  - **Validation approach:** Type-specific if/then blocks (lines 129-142); add similar block for Business OS types
  - **Extension points:**
    1. Add Business OS types to validation logic (after line 142)
    2. Add new allowed Status values if needed (lines 42-52)
    3. Registry auto-updates when docs have Type header (no changes needed)
  - **No tests exist:** Will create tests in BOS-07 task
- **Findings for BOS-07:**
  - Existing frontmatter fields validated: Type (required), Status (required + allowed list), Domain (required for Charter/Contract), hasCodePointers (required for Charter/Contract)
  - Validation method: String parsing (`line.startsWith("Type:")` etc.); no AST/YAML library
  - Extension is straightforward: add new if-block for Business OS types with required fields per type
  - Registry JSON schema: `{path, type, status, domain}[]` — sufficient for Business OS needs
  - Risk: No existing tests means we need comprehensive tests for new validation (noted in BOS-07)

### BOS-07: Extend `pnpm docs:lint` for Business OS validation

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `scripts/src/docs-lint.ts`, new file `scripts/src/docs-lint.test.ts`
- **Depends on:** BOS-06 (resolved)
- **Confidence:** 88%
  - Implementation: 90% — BOS-06 resolved; clear pattern to follow (lines 129-142); string-based parsing is simple
  - Approach: 88% — Type-specific validation blocks match existing pattern; no refactor needed
  - Impact: 85% — Additive changes only; existing validation logic untouched

#### Re-plan Update (2026-01-28)
- **Previous confidence:** 75%
- **Updated confidence:** 88%
  - Implementation: 90% — Extension point identified (after line 142 in docs-lint.ts); pattern is simple if/then blocks
  - Approach: 88% — Follow Charter/Contract pattern; add Business OS type-specific validation; dual-audience check is new but straightforward file existence check
  - Impact: 85% — Changes are isolated to new validation blocks; registry generation unchanged (auto-includes new types)
- **Investigation performed:**
  - Repo: `scripts/src/docs-lint.ts` lines 129-142 (Charter/Contract validation pattern)
  - No existing tests found — creating `scripts/src/docs-lint.test.ts` as part of this task
- **Decision / resolution:**
  - Add new validation block after line 142 for Business OS types: Idea, Card, Board, Business-Plan, People
  - Required fields per type:
    - Idea: Type, Status, Domain, Business-Code, Owner (warn)
    - Card: Type, Status, Domain, Business-Code, ID, Owner (warn), Evidence-Source-Type (warn)
    - Board: Type, Status, Domain, Business-Code
    - Business-Plan: Type, Status, Domain, Business-Code
    - People: Type, Status, Domain
  - Dual-audience pairing: walk file list; for each `.user.md`, check if `.agent.md` exists (and vice versa); warn if missing
  - Create comprehensive tests (no existing tests to follow; test framework TBD - repo uses Jest for Next.js apps per `package.json`)
- **Changes to task:**
  - Affects: Added `scripts/src/docs-lint.test.ts` (new test file)
  - Acceptance: Added test coverage requirement (no existing tests; must create from scratch)
  - Test plan: Updated to note no existing pattern; will follow `scripts/src/` testing conventions if they exist
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - Example test pattern from another `scripts/src/*.test.ts` file (check if any exist)
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Direct commit; run `pnpm docs:lint` in CI
  - Rollback: Git revert; Business OS docs not yet in repo (no validation failures)
- **Documentation impact:**
  - Update `docs/AGENTS.docs.md` section on docs:lint to mention Business OS types
- **Notes / references:**
  - Requirements lines 150-166 specify docs taxonomy alignment (Option A)
  - Validation strategy from `docs/AGENTS.docs.md` lines 485-490

### BOS-08: Create data access layer (repo reader)

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `apps/business-os/src/lib/repo/`, tests
- **Depends on:** BOS-02
- **Confidence:** 82%
  - Implementation: 85% — File reading straightforward; frontmatter parsing via string parsing (repo pattern at `index.ts:7` or similar)
  - Approach: 82% — Reader pattern is clear; caching strategy TBD (may need optimization later)
  - Impact: 78% — Core dependency for all UI; performance issues would cascade
- **Acceptance:**
  - Reader functions: `readBusinesses()`, `readIdeas(lane?)`, `readCard(id)`, `readBoards()`, `readPlans()`, `readPeople()`
  - Frontmatter parsed and validated (Zod schemas)
  - Markdown body content extracted
  - Error handling: missing files, malformed frontmatter, IO errors
  - Unit tests for each reader function
- **Test plan:**
  - Unit: Mock filesystem; test happy path and error cases
  - Run: `pnpm --filter @apps/business-os test repo-reader`
- **Planning validation:**
  - Tests run: N/A (new code)
  - Test stubs written: N/A (M effort; stubs optional)
  - Unexpected findings: None
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - Performance test with 100+ cards (verify read speed acceptable)
  - Caching strategy defined (in-memory vs request-scoped)
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Used by all API routes; no runtime toggle
  - Rollback: Git revert (no UI yet; safe to revert)
- **Documentation impact:**
  - JSDoc comments on reader functions
  - `apps/business-os/src/lib/repo/README.md` with architecture notes
- **Notes / references:**
  - Frontmatter parsing: follow repo pattern from `index.ts:7` or `docs-lint.ts:32-44` (line-based parsing; no external lib needed)
  - Follow async/await patterns from `packages/platform-core/src/repositories/`

### BOS-09: Implement server-side path authorization

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `apps/business-os/src/lib/auth/`, middleware
- **Depends on:** BOS-00-D (identity implementation), BOS-08 (repo reader)
- **Status:** Pending (blocked by BOS-00-D)
- **Confidence:** 65%
  - Implementation: 70% — Allowlist logic straightforward BUT depends on identity from BOS-00-D
  - Approach: 65% — Path-based authz correct BUT auth mechanism unknown (BOS-00-E unresolved)
  - Impact: 60% — Security-critical; errors could expose/block wrong paths; cannot test without auth
- **Acceptance:**
  - Function `authorizeWrite(userId: string, filePath: string)` returns boolean
  - Allowlist enforced:
    - Non-Pete users: only `docs/business-os/ideas/inbox/**` and `docs/business-os/cards/**/comments`
    - Pete + agents: all paths
  - Middleware applied to all write API routes
  - Unit tests: Pete can write anywhere, non-Pete blocked from plans/people/boards/lane-changes
- **Test plan:**
  - Unit: `apps/business-os/src/lib/auth/authorize.test.ts`
  - Integration: Mock write requests as Pete and non-Pete; verify allowlist
  - Run: `pnpm --filter @apps/business-os test authorize`
- **Planning validation:**
  - Tests run: N/A (new code)
  - Test stubs written: N/A (M effort; stubs optional)
  - Unexpected findings: None
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - Penetration test: attempt to write to restricted paths via API (manual or E2E)
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Applied at middleware level; no feature flag
  - Rollback: Git revert (pre-launch; no users affected)
- **Documentation impact:**
  - `docs/business-os/security.md` document authorization model
- **Notes / references:**
  - Requirements lines 330-350 specify path-level authorization
  - Follow middleware pattern from `apps/cms/src/middleware.ts`

### BOS-10: Create repo write operations with git integration

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `apps/business-os/src/lib/repo/writer.ts`, tests
- **Depends on:** BOS-00-A (deployment runtime), BOS-09 (authorization), BOS-18 (resolved)
- **Status:** Pending (major blockers resolved; BOS-00-A partial)
- **Confidence:** 70% 🟡 BUILD-ELIGIBLE
  - Implementation: 75% — BOS-18 resolved (isomorphic-git), BOS-00-F resolved (Node runtime confirmed), writable checkout proven for local Phase 0; credentials via git config for local-only
  - Approach: 70% — BOS-00-B resolved (governance via auto-PR workflow); write cycle design clear: commit to work/* branch → auto-PR → auto-merge
  - Impact: 65% — Core write path now has safety mechanism (auto-PR + CI gates); governance aligned; local runtime proven; hosted deployment still partial (BOS-00-A at 40%)

#### Re-plan Update (2026-01-28) - MAJOR BLOCKERS RESOLVED
- **Previous confidence:** 85% (initial re-plan), then 45% (after review), then 30% (after adding BOS-00-F blocker)
- **Updated confidence:** 70% 🟡 BUILD-ELIGIBLE (major blockers resolved)
- **Resolved blockers (2 of 4 existential blockers now complete):**
  - **BOS-00-B (✅ RESOLVED):** Governance resolved via auto-PR workflow. App commits to work/* branches → auto-PR creates PR → auto-merge after CI passes. Preserves audit trail, rollback capability, and repo governance.
  - **BOS-00-F (✅ RESOLVED):** Node runtime confirmed for all git/filesystem routes. Add `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` to API routes. Follows repo pattern from cart/media/guides.
- **Remaining partial blocker:**
  - **BOS-00-A (40% incomplete):** Local Phase 0 runtime decided (Pete's machine, writable checkout) BUT hosted mechanism unproven (Vercel/CF serverless read-only). Acceptable for Phase 0; must resolve for Phase 1+ hosted deployment.
- **Resolved dependencies:**
  - Git access model: Isomorphic-git (BOS-18) + Node runtime (BOS-00-F) + writable local checkout (BOS-00-A local) ✅ Viable for Phase 0
  - Governance safety: Auto-PR workflow (BOS-00-B) provides CI gates, audit trail, rollback ✅
  - Branch protection: No bypass needed; use work/* branches per repo convention ✅
- **Remaining unresolved for ≥80%:**
  - Credentials handling for local git config (simple: use existing git config; no env vars needed for Phase 0)
  - Concurrency/locking: Single-writer Phase 0 OK; multi-writer Phase 1+ undefined (acceptable gap for now)
  - Hosted deployment: BOS-00-A unresolved for hosted; not needed for Phase 0
- **Why confidence increased 40 points (30% → 70%):**
  - Implementation: 35% → 75% (Node runtime confirmed, isomorphic-git viable, local writable checkout proven)
  - Approach: 30% → 70% (governance resolved via auto-PR; write cycle design clear and safe)
  - Impact: 25% → 65% (safety mechanism in place; governance aligned; local runtime proven)
- **Path to ≥90%:**
  - Test credentials handling in local git config (verify name/email from `~/.gitconfig`)
  - Integration test: Write operation → auto-PR created → auto-merge completes
  - Performance test: Write cycle time <2s acceptable for Phase 0 (includes PR creation + merge wait)
- **Acceptance:**
  - Writer functions: `writeIdea()`, `writeCard()`, `updateCard()`, `writeComment()`, `archiveCard()`
  - Git operations: pull latest, apply change, commit, push (with retry on conflict)
  - Commit authorship: real user identity (name/email) or agent identity
  - Atomic operations: fail fast if pull/commit/push fails
  - Unit tests: mock git operations; test conflict retry, authorship, error handling
  - **isomorphic-git implementation:**
    - Install: `pnpm add isomorphic-git` in `apps/business-os`
    - Import: `import git from 'isomorphic-git'` + `import fs from 'fs'`
    - Write cycle: `git.pull()` → fs write → `git.add()` → `git.commit()` → `git.push()`
    - Conflict retry: max 3 attempts with exponential backoff (100ms, 200ms, 400ms)
    - Auth: env vars `GIT_USERNAME`, `GIT_PASSWORD` or config file
- **Test plan:**
  - Unit: `apps/business-os/src/lib/repo/writer.test.ts` (mocked git)
  - Integration: Real git repo in test env; simulate concurrent writes
  - Run: `pnpm --filter @apps/business-os test writer`
- **Planning validation:**
  - Tests run: N/A (new code; L effort)
  - Test stubs written: Required for L effort; to be created during implementation
  - Unexpected findings: None
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - Conflict resolution strategy tested in integration tests (concurrent writes)
  - Rollback strategy validated (can revert commit if subsequent operation fails)
  - Performance test: write cycle time <500ms (acceptable for Phase 0)
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Phase 0 app; no production traffic yet
  - Rollback: Git revert (manual; app not deployed)
- **Documentation impact:**
  - `apps/business-os/src/lib/repo/README.md` document git operations and error handling
- **Notes / references:**
  - Requirements lines 312-358 specify repo write model and commit identity
  - Git library: isomorphic-git (pure JS, no native deps) per BOS-18 decision
  - isomorphic-git docs: https://isomorphic-git.org/docs/en/quickstart

### BOS-11: Build board view components

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `apps/business-os/src/app/boards/`, `apps/business-os/src/components/board/`
- **Depends on:** BOS-04, BOS-08
- **Confidence:** 80%
  - Implementation: 82% — Board UI is standard Kanban; drag-drop libraries exist (react-beautiful-dnd, dnd-kit)
  - Approach: 80% — Computed ordering means no drag-drop for reordering; simpler implementation
  - Impact: 78% — UI component; low risk but high visibility
- **Acceptance:**
  - Board page: `/boards/[businessCode]` and `/boards/global`
  - Lanes rendered: Inbox (Ideas), Fact-finding, Planned, In progress, Blocked, Done, Reflected
  - Cards displayed per lane (compact view): title, owner, priority, next action, updated date, business (global only)
  - Computed ordering: priority (P0→P5), due date (earliest first), last-updated (newest first), created (newest first)
  - Click card → navigate to card detail
  - Responsive design (desktop + mobile)
- **Test plan:**
  - Unit: Component tests for Board, Lane, CompactCard (Jest + React Testing Library, matching repo Next.js pattern)
  - Manual: Visual QA on dev server
  - Run: `pnpm --filter @apps/business-os test board`
- **Planning validation:**
  - Tests run: N/A (new code)
  - Test stubs written: N/A (M effort; stubs optional)
  - Unexpected findings: None
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - Accessibility audit (keyboard nav, screen reader support)
  - Design system components confirmed sufficient (no custom primitives needed)
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Direct commit; app not deployed
  - Rollback: Git revert (UI only; no data changes)
- **Documentation impact:**
  - `apps/business-os/README.md` add UI overview section
- **Notes / references:**
  - Requirements lines 262-297 specify board and card UI
  - Use `@acme/ui` Card, Badge, Button components
  - Ordering logic from requirements lines 232-240

### BOS-12: Build card detail view

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `apps/business-os/src/app/cards/[id]/`, `apps/business-os/src/components/card-detail/`
- **Depends on:** BOS-11
- **Confidence:** 82%
  - Implementation: 85% — Detail view is read-heavy; markdown rendering straightforward
  - Approach: 82% — Task checklist embedded in card; may need collapsible sections for long cards
  - Impact: 78% — High-visibility UI; performance matters if card content is large
- **Acceptance:**
  - Card detail page: `/cards/[id]`
  - Displays: full title, one-sentence summary, owner, contributors, priority, due date, lane, Proposed-Lane
  - Embedded task checklist (fine-grained, not top-level task IDs)
  - Risk & evidence gating fields (explicit display of evidence sources)
  - Dependencies: other cards (linked), external (listed)
  - Links: plan/people docs, related cards, commits, PRs
  - Lightweight history: recent updates/comments (append-only log)
  - Markdown rendering for card body and stage docs

### BOS-13: Build raw idea submission form

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `apps/business-os/src/app/ideas/new/`, `apps/business-os/src/app/api/ideas/route.ts`
- **Depends on:** BOS-04, BOS-10
- **Confidence:** 88%
  - Implementation: 90% — Form with react-hook-form + Zod validation; standard pattern
  - Approach: 88% — Server action writes to `ideas/inbox/`; authorization checked (BOS-09)
  - Impact: 85% — User-facing form; errors visible but low impact (only creates draft idea)
- **Acceptance:**
  - Form page: `/ideas/new`
  - Fields: title (required), description (required), business (dropdown from businesses.json), owner (default: submitter)
  - Zod schema validation client + server
  - Server action: `POST /api/ideas` → writes `docs/business-os/ideas/inbox/<ID>.user.md`
  - Success: redirect to `/ideas/inbox` (list view)
  - Error handling: display validation errors, git errors
- **Test plan:**
  - Unit: Form validation tests
  - Integration: Submit form, verify file created in repo
  - Run: `pnpm --filter @apps/business-os test ideas-form`
- **Planning validation:**
  - Tests run: N/A (new code)
  - Test stubs written: N/A (S effort)
  - Unexpected findings: None
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - UX review: confirm form fields sufficient for idea capture
- **Rollout / rollback:**

- **Notes / references:**
  - Requirements lines 209-227 specify raw idea visibility and ownership
  - Follow form pattern from `apps/cms/src/components/forms/`

### BOS-14: Implement board filtering and computed ordering

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `apps/business-os/src/lib/board-logic.ts`, tests
- **Depends on:** BOS-11
- **Confidence:** 85%
  - Implementation: 88% — Sorting and filtering logic straightforward; array operations
  - Approach: 85% — Global board filter (Priority ∈ {P0,P1}) is clear; business board shows all
  - Impact: 82% — Incorrect ordering would confuse users but not corrupt data
- **Acceptance:**
  - Function `filterCardsForBoard(cards, boardType, businessCode?)` returns filtered cards
  - Global board: only cards with Priority = P0 or P1
  - Business board: all cards for that business
  - Function `orderCards(cards)` returns sorted by: priority (P0→P5), due date (earliest), last-updated (newest), created (newest)
  - Unit tests: verify ordering with various card states, verify global filter
- **Test plan:**
  - Unit: `apps/business-os/src/lib/board-logic.test.ts`
  - Run: `pnpm --filter @apps/business-os test board-logic`
- **Planning validation:**
  - Tests run: N/A (new code)
  - Test stubs written: N/A (M effort; stubs optional)
  - Unexpected findings: None
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - Performance test: ordering 500+ cards (verify sub-100ms)
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Used by board views (BOS-11); no separate toggle
  - Rollback: Git revert (logic only; no persisted state)
- **Documentation impact:**
  - None (internal logic; JSDoc sufficient)
- **Notes / references:**
  - Requirements lines 228-240 specify priority and ordering rules

### BOS-15: Build plan/people presentation views (read-only)

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `apps/business-os/src/app/plans/`, `apps/business-os/src/app/people/`, components
- **Depends on:** BOS-08
- **Confidence:** 80%
  - Implementation: 82% — Markdown rendering + structured layout; similar to card detail
  - Approach: 80% — Presentation-optimized view; unclear if special formatting needed beyond markdown
  - Impact: 78% — Read-only view; low risk but user expectations high for "presentation" format
- **Acceptance:**
  - Plan view: `/plans/[businessCode]` renders `docs/business-os/strategy/<BIZ>/plan.user.md`
  - People view: `/people` renders `docs/business-os/people/people.user.md`
  - Markdown rendered with headings, lists, links
  - Anchor links functional (for change request targeting)
  - Responsive design
- **Test plan:**
  - Unit: Component tests for PlanView, PeopleView components (Jest + React Testing Library)
  - Manual: Visual QA with sample plan/people docs
  - Run: `pnpm --filter @apps/business-os test plan-view`
- **Planning validation:**
  - Tests run: N/A (new code)
  - Test stubs written: N/A (M effort; stubs optional)
  - Unexpected findings: None
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - User feedback on presentation format (is plain markdown sufficient or need custom styling?)
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Direct commit; no feature flag
  - Rollback: Git revert (UI only)
- **Documentation impact:**
  - None (UI; covered by app README)
- **Notes / references:**
  - Requirements lines 298-310 specify plan/people rendering

### BOS-16: Implement change request mechanism for plans/people

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `apps/business-os/src/app/api/change-requests/route.ts`, components
- **Depends on:** BOS-13, BOS-15
- **Confidence:** 82%
  - Implementation: 85% — Change request as raw idea works; anchoring via markdown heading IDs (standard pattern)
  - Approach: 82% — Reusing idea infrastructure is pragmatic; Phase 0 workflow acceptable (separate UI deferred)
  - Impact: 78% — Indirect workflow mitigated by clear UI messaging; Pete reviews all change requests

#### Re-plan Update (2026-01-28)
- **Previous confidence:** 78%
- **Updated confidence:** 82%
  - Implementation: 85% — Anchor ID generation: use markdown heading slug (e.g., `## Strategy` → `#strategy`); standard in markdown renderers
  - Approach: 82% — Indirect workflow (change request → idea inbox → Pete/agent action) is acceptable for Phase 0; future: dedicated change request UI
  - Impact: 78% — Clear UX messaging ("Your change request has been submitted to Pete for review") reduces confusion; Pete supervision ensures quality
- **Changes to task:**
  - Acceptance: Added anchor ID generation approach (markdown heading slugs)
  - Documentation impact: User guide explains change request workflow clearly
- **Acceptance:**
  - In plan/people view, user can click "Request change" on any heading/element
  - Modal form: description (required), anchor ID (optional), submit
  - Server action: creates raw idea in `ideas/inbox/` with metadata: `change-request: true`, `target-doc: <path>`, `anchor: <id>`
  - Success: notify user "Change request submitted; Pete/agent will review"
  - Change requests visible in ideas inbox (tagged)
- **Test plan:**
  - Integration: Submit change request, verify idea created with correct metadata
  - Manual: UX flow from plan view → request → ideas inbox
  - Run: `pnpm --filter @apps/business-os test change-request`
- **Planning validation:**
  - Tests run: N/A (new code)
  - Test stubs written: N/A (M effort; stubs optional)
  - Unexpected findings: None
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - UX prototype: confirm users understand change request flow
  - Anchor ID generation strategy (stable heading IDs in markdown)
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Direct commit; no feature flag
  - Rollback: Git revert (adds to ideas inbox; can be manually deleted)
- **Documentation impact:**
  - User guide: `docs/business-os/user-guide.md` section on change requests
- **Notes / references:**
  - Requirements lines 359-366 specify change request mechanism

### BOS-17: Create archive mechanism and UI filtering

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `apps/business-os/src/lib/repo/archive.ts`, board/card list components
- **Depends on:** BOS-08
- **Confidence:** 85%
  - Implementation: 88% — Git mv to archive/ + update frontmatter; straightforward
  - Approach: 85% — Archive subdirectories match repo conventions
  - Impact: 82% — UI filter must hide archived items; regression would show clutter
- **Acceptance:**
  - Function `archiveItem(type, id)` moves file to `archive/` subdirectory and updates status
  - Card status: Dropped → archive to `cards/archive/`
  - Idea status: Dropped → archive to `ideas/{inbox,worked}/archive/`
  - UI filtering: board views, idea lists, search exclude archived items (unless "Show archived" toggled)
  - Unit tests: verify file moved, frontmatter updated, UI filter works
- **Test plan:**
  - Unit: `apps/business-os/src/lib/repo/archive.test.ts`
  - Integration: Archive a card, verify board no longer shows it
  - Run: `pnpm --filter @apps/business-os test archive`
- **Planning validation:**
  - Tests run: N/A (new code)
  - Test stubs written: N/A (S effort)
  - Unexpected findings: None
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - Unarchive function implemented (for accidental archives)
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Direct commit; no feature flag
  - Rollback: Git revert (no archived items yet)
- **Documentation impact:**
  - User guide: `docs/business-os/user-guide.md` section on archiving
- **Notes / references:**
  - Requirements lines 140-149 specify archive policy

### BOS-18: Choose git library (isomorphic-git vs simple-git vs nodegit)

- **Type:** DECISION
- **Affects:** `apps/business-os/package.json`, `apps/business-os/src/lib/repo/git.ts`
- **Depends on:** -
- **Status:** Complete (2026-01-28)
- **Confidence:** 100%
  - Implementation: 100% — Decision made; isomorphic-git API well-documented
  - Approach: 100% — Option A chosen per user directive
  - Impact: 100% — Trade-offs understood and accepted for Phase 0
- **Decision:** Option A (isomorphic-git) — CHOSEN
  - **Rationale:** Pure JS with no native dependencies; runs in Node + browser/Edge; actively maintained. Best fit for Phase 0 constraints favoring simplicity + portability over raw performance. Performance is acceptable for Phase 0 scale (<100 cards expected). Migration path to simple-git documented if performance issues arise at scale.
- **Options evaluated:**
  - **Option A: isomorphic-git** ✓ CHOSEN
    - Pros: Pure JS, no native deps, runs in Node + browser, actively maintained
    - Cons: Slower than native git CLI, limited feature set (no partial clone, sparse checkout)
    - Trade-offs: Best for Vercel/Edge deployments; acceptable for Phase 0 scale
  - **Option B: simple-git** (not chosen)
    - Pros: Wraps git CLI (fast), feature-complete, widely used
    - Cons: Requires git binary installed, not portable to browser/Edge
    - Trade-offs: Best for traditional Node server; assumes git in PATH
  - **Option C: nodegit** (not chosen)
    - Pros: Native bindings (fast), feature-complete
    - Cons: Native compilation required, maintenance concerns, complex install
    - Trade-offs: Best for performance; worst for deployment simplicity
- **Implementation notes for BOS-10:**
  - Install: `pnpm add isomorphic-git` in `apps/business-os`
  - Import: `import git from 'isomorphic-git'` + `import fs from 'fs'` (Node fs API)
  - Key operations: `git.clone()`, `git.pull()`, `git.add()`, `git.commit()`, `git.push()`
  - Auth: Use callbacks for credentials (support env vars + config file)
  - Conflict handling: Check status before commit; retry on push failure with fresh pull
- **Acceptance:**
  - [x] User confirmed Option A (2026-01-28)
  - [ ] BOS-10 updated with isomorphic-git implementation notes (pending)
  - [ ] BOS-10 confidence updated to ≥85% (pending)

### BOS-19: Implement lane transition validation and stage doc creation

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `apps/business-os/src/lib/repo/lane-transitions.ts`, tests
- **Depends on:** BOS-10
- **Confidence:** 85%
  - Implementation: 88% — Template generation is straightforward file write; validation is lookup table (lane → required stage doc)
  - Approach: 85% — Always-on stage docs (Option 2) accepted; minimal placeholders are sufficient (agent populates during work)
  - Impact: 82% — Enforced at write time (BOS-10); UI reads stage docs; missing docs caught early; no UI breakage

#### Re-plan Update (2026-01-28)
- **Previous confidence:** 75%
- **Updated confidence:** 85%
  - Implementation: 88% — Simple logic: map lane to stage doc filename, check existence, create from template if missing
  - Approach: 85% — Minimal placeholder approach confirmed: frontmatter + 1-2 sentence placeholder body; agent skill populates details during fact-find/plan/build/reflect phases
  - Impact: 82% — Always-on requirement enforced at BOS-10 (write operations); UI assumes stage docs exist; validation prevents missing docs
- **Decision / resolution:**
  - **Stage doc templates (minimal placeholders):**
    - `fact-find.(user|agent).md`: Frontmatter: Type: Fact-Find, Status: Draft, Card-ID: <ID>. Body: "Fact-finding in progress."
    - `plan.(user|agent).md`: Frontmatter: Type: Plan, Status: Draft, Card-ID: <ID>. Body: "Planning in progress."
    - `build.(user|agent).md`: Frontmatter: Type: Build-Log, Status: Draft, Card-ID: <ID>. Body: "Work in progress."
    - `reflect.(user|agent).md`: Frontmatter: Type: Reflection, Status: Draft, Card-ID: <ID>. Body: "Reflection pending."
  - **Validation rules (prerequisite checks):**
    - No prerequisite checks in Phase 0; always-on means stage docs created automatically on lane entry
    - Future: could add "can't move to Planned without completing fact-find" validation if needed
- **Changes to task:**
  - Acceptance: Removed prerequisite validation (not required in Phase 0; always-on is sufficient)
  - Acceptance: Added specific template structure (frontmatter + placeholder body)
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - Template examples reviewed by user (confirm frontmatter fields + placeholder text acceptable)

### BOS-20: Build dependency tracking and cycle detection

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `apps/business-os/src/lib/dependencies.ts`, tests
- **Depends on:** BOS-08
- **Confidence:** 85%
  - Implementation: 88% — DFS cycle detection is standard algorithm; directed graph represented as adjacency list (card → [dependsOn: cardIds]); clear implementation path
  - Approach: 85% — Cross-business dependencies allowed; cycle detection required; algorithm choice (DFS with recursion stack) is correct
  - Impact: 82% — Validation at write time (BOS-10); incorrect detection would be caught by tests; Phase 0 scale (<100 cards) reduces perf risk

#### Re-plan Update (2026-01-28)
- **Previous confidence:** 72%
- **Updated confidence:** 85%
  - Implementation: 88% — DFS with recursion stack (visited + recursion stack to detect back edges); standard directed graph cycle detection; 20-30 lines of code
  - Approach: 85% — Algorithm choice confirmed correct: DFS detects all cycles in directed graph; adjacency list representation (card.dependsOn: string[]) is efficient
  - Impact: 82% — Comprehensive unit tests (6+ scenarios) catch errors; Phase 0 scale (<100 cards, <200 edges) means O(V+E) performance acceptable (<10ms)
- **Investigation performed:**
  - Algorithm: DFS cycle detection pseudocode reviewed; standard approach in graph theory
  - Data structure: Cards have `dependsOn: string[]` field (list of card IDs); build adjacency list from card array
  - Performance: O(V+E) where V=cards, E=dependencies; Phase 0: ~50 cards, ~100 deps → <5ms
- **Decision / resolution:**
  - **Algorithm (DFS with recursion stack):**
    ```typescript
    function detectCycles(cards: Card[]): string[][] {
      const adjList = buildAdjList(cards); // card.id -> card.dependsOn[]
      const visited = new Set<string>();
      const recStack = new Set<string>();
      const cycles: string[][] = [];

      function dfs(cardId: string, path: string[]): void {
        visited.add(cardId);
        recStack.add(cardId);
        path.push(cardId);

        for (const depId of adjList[cardId] || []) {
          if (!visited.has(depId)) {
            dfs(depId, path);
          } else if (recStack.has(depId)) {
            // Back edge found → cycle detected
            const cycleStart = path.indexOf(depId);
            cycles.push(path.slice(cycleStart));
          }
        }

        recStack.delete(cardId);
        path.pop();
      }

      for (const card of cards) {
        if (!visited.has(card.id)) dfs(card.id, []);
      }

      return cycles;
    }
    ```
  - **Unit test scenarios:**
    1. No cycles (A→B→C) → return []
    2. Simple cycle (A→B→A) → return [[A,B,A]]
    3. Complex cycle (A→B→C→A) → return [[A,B,C,A]]
    4. Multiple cycles (A→B→A, C→D→C) → return [[A,B,A], [C,D,C]]
    5. Self-loop (A→A) → return [[A,A]]
    6. Cross-business dependency (BRIK-001→PLAT-002→BRIK-001) → return [[BRIK-001,PLAT-002,BRIK-001]]
- **Changes to task:**
  - Acceptance: Added algorithm pseudocode for clarity
  - Test plan: Added 6 specific test scenarios
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - Code review of implemented DFS (confirm recursion stack logic correct)

### BOS-21: Create agent skill: `/work-idea`

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `.claude/skills/work-idea/SKILL.md`
- **Depends on:** BOS-07
- **Confidence:** 88%
  - Implementation: 90% — Skill structure clear from `.claude/skills/fact-find/SKILL.md` (100 lines; name, description, workflow sections); logic straightforward
  - Approach: 88% — Reusing existing skill structure is proven; "worked up" = validate required fields + clarify scope (defined below)
  - Impact: 85% — Agent creates cards; BOS-07 validates via docs:lint; malformed cards caught before commit

#### Re-plan Update (2026-01-28)
- **Previous confidence:** 78%
- **Updated confidence:** 88%
  - Implementation: 90% — Skill template pattern clear from existing skills (19 skills in `.claude/skills/`); frontmatter + workflow sections
  - Approach: 88% — "Worked up to standard" defined as: (1) all required fields populated per BOS-07 validation, (2) scope clarified (1-3 sentence summary), (3) business code assigned, (4) owner assigned
  - Impact: 85% — Validation via docs:lint (BOS-07) catches malformed cards; agent runs are Pete-supervised in Phase 0; low blast radius
- **Investigation performed:**
  - Repo: `.claude/skills/fact-find/SKILL.md` (template: frontmatter, Operating Mode, Workflow, Outputs)
  - Repo: 19 existing skills in `.claude/skills/` (consistent structure)
  - Requirements: lines 209-227 (raw idea → worked idea → card workflow)
- **Decision / resolution:**
  - **Worked idea quality rubric:**
    - Required fields: Business-Code, Owner, Title, Description (≥3 sentences), Status: Worked
    - Scope clarity: 1-sentence summary of opportunity + impact/value statement
    - Completeness check: all required frontmatter fields from BOS-07 validation rules
  - **Skill workflow:**
    1. Read raw idea from `docs/business-os/ideas/inbox/<ID>.user.md`
    2. Analyze: extract business code, clarify scope, assign owner (default: submitter)
    3. Generate: worked idea at `docs/business-os/ideas/worked/<ID>.user.md` + `.agent.md`
    4. Create card: `docs/business-os/cards/<ID>.user.md` + `.agent.md` with Lane: Inbox (Ideas)
    5. Validate: run `pnpm docs:lint` to ensure compliance
- **Changes to task:**
  - Acceptance: Added specific "worked up" rubric (required fields + scope clarity)
  - Notes: Added workflow detail (5 steps from raw → worked + card)
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - Example raw idea and expected worked idea output (can provide as template in skill doc)

### BOS-22: Create agent skill: `/propose-lane-move`

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `.claude/skills/propose-lane-move/SKILL.md`, agent scripts
- **Depends on:** BOS-07
- **Confidence:** 80%
  - Implementation: 82% — Simple skill: read card, analyze stage docs, propose lane via Proposed-Lane frontmatter
  - Approach: 80% — Proposal mechanism (frontmatter field) is clear
  - Impact: 78% — Agent proposes only; Pete approves; low risk
- **Acceptance:**
  - Skill doc: `.claude/skills/propose-lane-move/SKILL.md`
  - Agent workflow: read card, verify stage docs complete, check evidence gates, propose next lane via `Proposed-Lane: <lane>` in card frontmatter
  - Evidence references included in proposal (link to specific stage doc sections)
  - Manual test: Pete runs skill, verifies proposal added to card
- **Test plan:**
  - Manual: Run skill, inspect card frontmatter
  - Run: N/A (agent skill; manual testing)
- **Planning validation:**
  - Tests run: N/A (new code)
  - Test stubs written: N/A (S effort)
  - Unexpected findings: None
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - Proposal approval UI implemented (separate task; BOS-22 just creates proposal)
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Pete runs skill manually
  - Rollback: Git revert card frontmatter change
- **Documentation impact:**
  - `docs/business-os/agent-workflows.md` document `/propose-lane-move` usage
- **Notes / references:**
  - Requirements lines 403-410 specify lane move proposals

### BOS-23: Create agent skill: `/scan-repo`

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `.claude/skills/scan-repo/SKILL.md`
- **Depends on:** BOS-07
- **Confidence:** 82%
  - Implementation: 82% — Git diff/status commands straightforward; JSON file I/O is simple; scan scope limited to `docs/business-os/`
  - Approach: 85% — Scan mechanism (last-scan.json + active-docs.json) is clear; integration with cards is informational only (not automated triggers)
  - Impact: 78% — Scan artifacts inform agent context; errors would miss changes but not corrupt data or block work

#### Re-plan Update (2026-01-28)
- **Previous confidence:** 75%
- **Updated confidence:** 82%
  - Implementation: 82% — Git commands via Bash tool: `git diff <commit-hash>...HEAD --name-status -- docs/business-os/` and `git status --porcelain docs/business-os/`; parse output line-by-line
  - Approach: 85% — Scan integration clarified: **informational only**; scan results provide context for agent prompts (e.g., "since last scan, 3 cards updated"); no automated triggers in Phase 0
  - Impact: 78% — Scan scope limited to `docs/business-os/`; errors would miss context but not break core workflows; idempotent (can re-run)
- **Investigation performed:**
  - Git commands: `git diff <commit>...HEAD --name-status` (outputs: `M path/to/file`, `A path/to/file`, `D path/to/file`)
  - Git commands: `git status --porcelain` (outputs: ` M unstaged`, `M  staged`, `?? untracked`)
  - Scan scope: Only `docs/business-os/**` (narrow scope reduces parse complexity)
- **Decision / resolution:**
  - **Scan integration workflow (Phase 0):**
    1. Agent runs `/scan-repo` manually (Pete-triggered)
    2. Scan outputs `scans/last-scan.json`: `{lastCommit, scanDate, changedFiles: [{path, status}]}`
    3. Scan outputs `scans/active-docs.json`: `{cards: [{id, lane, lastUpdated}], ideas: [...], plans: [...]}`
    4. Scan outputs `scans/history/<timestamp>.json`: snapshot for audit trail
    5. **Agent uses scan results as context input** for subsequent tasks (e.g., "3 cards in Fact-finding updated since last scan; prioritize review")
    6. No automated actions in Phase 0; future: trigger notifications, auto-assign reviews
  - **Scan performance:** Scope limited to `docs/business-os/` (expected <50 files in Phase 0); scan time <1s acceptable
- **Changes to task:**
  - Acceptance: Added scan output schema (`last-scan.json`, `active-docs.json`, `history/<timestamp>.json`)
  - Acceptance: Clarified scan integration: informational context only (no automated triggers)
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - Example scan output JSON structure documented (can provide in skill doc)

### BOS-24: Create agent skill: `/update-business-plan`

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `.claude/skills/update-business-plan/SKILL.md`
- **Depends on:** BOS-07
- **Confidence:** 82%
  - Implementation: 82% — Plan update logic straightforward: extract learnings from reflect.agent.md, append/update plan sections, dual-audience mirroring
  - Approach: 85% — Reflection → plan update workflow clear; skill follows existing pattern; Pete reviews all changes
  - Impact: 78% — Agent edits business plans; Pete supervision + git history ensure quality; errors are visible and revertible

#### Re-plan Update (2026-01-28)
- **Previous confidence:** 78%
- **Updated confidence:** 82%
  - Implementation: 82% — Skill workflow: read `reflect.agent.md` → extract structured learnings (decisions, risks, opportunities) → update corresponding sections in `strategy/<BIZ>/plan.(user|agent).md`
  - Approach: 85% — Plan update sections defined: Strategy (new opportunities), Risks (emerging risks), Opportunities (validated ideas), Learnings (append-only log)
  - Impact: 78% — Pete reviews all plan changes before merge; git diff shows exactly what changed; low risk of silent corruption
- **Changes to task:**
  - Acceptance: Added plan update rubric (which sections: Strategy, Risks, Opportunities, Learnings)
- **Acceptance:**
  - Skill doc: `.claude/skills/update-business-plan/SKILL.md`
  - Agent workflow: read card `reflect.agent.md`, extract learnings/decisions, update `strategy/<BIZ>/plan.(user|agent).md`, commit with descriptive message
  - Dual-audience: changes mirrored to `.user.md` and `.agent.md`
  - Manual test: Pete runs skill after reflection, verifies plan updated
- **Test plan:**
  - Manual: Run skill with test reflection, inspect plan diff
  - Run: N/A (agent skill; manual testing)
- **Planning validation:**
  - Tests run: N/A (new code)
  - Test stubs written: N/A (M effort; stubs optional)
  - Unexpected findings: None
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - Plan update rubric: what sections of plan.md should be updated? (Strategy, risks, opportunities?)
  - Example reflection → plan delta provided
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Pete runs skill manually
  - Rollback: Git revert plan changes (Pete reviews diffs)
- **Documentation impact:**
  - `docs/business-os/agent-workflows.md` document `/update-business-plan` usage

### BOS-25: Create agent skill: `/update-people`

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `.claude/skills/update-people/SKILL.md`
- **Depends on:** BOS-07
- **Confidence:** 82%
  - Implementation: 82% — People update logic similar to BOS-24; extract people-related learnings, update people.(user|agent).md sections
  - Approach: 85% — People doc structure assumed: Roles, Responsibilities, Capabilities, Gaps; reflection outputs suggest updates to these sections
  - Impact: 78% — Agent edits people docs; Pete supervision + git history ensure quality

#### Re-plan Update (2026-01-28)
- **Previous confidence:** 78%
- **Updated confidence:** 82%
  - Implementation: 82% — Skill workflow: read `reflect.agent.md` → extract people-related changes (new responsibilities, skill gaps, role changes) → update `people/people.(user|agent).md`
  - Approach: 85% — People doc structure defined: Roles (who does what), Responsibilities (detailed duties), Capabilities (current skills), Gaps (identified needs)
  - Impact: 78% — Pete reviews all people changes; sensitive updates (role changes, capability gaps) are visible in git diff
- **Changes to task:**
  - Acceptance: Added people doc structure (Roles, Responsibilities, Capabilities, Gaps)
- **Acceptance:**
  - Skill doc: `.claude/skills/update-people/SKILL.md`
  - Agent workflow: read card `reflect.agent.md`, extract people-related changes (new responsibilities, capability gaps), update `people/people.(user|agent).md`, commit
  - Dual-audience: changes mirrored
  - Manual test: Pete runs skill, verifies people doc updated
- **Test plan:**
  - Manual: Run skill with test reflection, inspect people doc diff
  - Run: N/A (agent skill; manual testing)
- **Planning validation:**
  - Tests run: N/A (new code)
  - Test stubs written: N/A (M effort; stubs optional)
  - Unexpected findings: None
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - People doc structure defined (sections, fields, format)
  - Example reflection → people delta provided
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Pete runs skill manually
  - Rollback: Git revert people changes
- **Documentation impact:**
  - `docs/business-os/agent-workflows.md` document `/update-people` usage
- **Notes / references:**
  - Requirements lines 417-431 specify agent duties

### BOS-26: Implement evidence source typing system

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `apps/business-os/src/types/evidence.ts`, card detail UI
- **Depends on:** BOS-08
- **Confidence:** 85%
  - Implementation: 88% — Enum + Zod validation straightforward; UI dropdown simple
  - Approach: 85% — Evidence source typing is well-defined; enum extensible
  - Impact: 82% — Type enforcement is warning-only in Phase 0; low impact if incorrect
- **Acceptance:**
  - Enum `EvidenceSourceType` with values: measurement, customer-input, repo-diff, experiment, financial-model, vendor-quote, legal, assumption, other
  - Zod schema validates evidence source type in card frontmatter
  - Card detail UI displays evidence sources with type badges
  - `pnpm docs:lint` warns if evidence lacks source type
  - Unit tests: validate each enum value, reject invalid values
- **Test plan:**
  - Unit: `apps/business-os/src/types/evidence.test.ts`
  - Run: `pnpm --filter @apps/business-os test evidence`
- **Planning validation:**
  - Tests run: N/A (new code)
  - Test stubs written: N/A (S effort)
  - Unexpected findings: None
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - User confirmation: is enum complete, or should we add more types?
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Direct commit; warnings only (no blocking errors)
  - Rollback: Git revert (type system only; no data changes)
- **Documentation impact:**
  - `docs/business-os/evidence-guide.md` document evidence source types and usage
- **Notes / references:**
  - Requirements lines 367-388 specify evidence gates and source typing

### BOS-27: Add commit identity management (user vs agent)

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `apps/business-os/src/lib/repo/git.ts`, writer functions
- **Depends on:** BOS-10
- **Confidence:** 82%
  - Implementation: 85% — Git commit author/email set via git config or commit options
  - Approach: 82% — Identity passed as parameter to write functions; clear separation
  - Impact: 78% — Incorrect identity would misattribute commits but not break functionality
- **Acceptance:**
  - Function `setCommitIdentity(name, email)` configures git author for next commit
  - Writer functions accept `identity: {name, email}` parameter
  - User commits: use real user identity (from session or config)
  - Agent commits: use agent identity (e.g., "Claude Agent <agent@business-os.internal>")
  - Unit tests: verify commit author set correctly
- **Test plan:**
  - Unit: Mock git operations, verify author/email in commit
  - Integration: Real git commit, inspect `git log` for author
  - Run: `pnpm --filter @apps/business-os test git-identity`
- **Planning validation:**
  - Tests run: N/A (new code)
  - Test stubs written: N/A (S effort)
  - Unexpected findings: None
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - User identity source confirmed (session, env var, or config file?)
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Direct commit; enforced in writer functions
  - Rollback: Git revert (identity logic only; existing commits unchanged)
- **Documentation impact:**
  - `apps/business-os/src/lib/repo/README.md` document commit identity management
- **Notes / references:**
  - Requirements lines 318-325 specify commit authorship

### BOS-28: Build lightweight history view for cards

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `apps/business-os/src/components/card-detail/CardHistory.tsx`
- **Depends on:** BOS-12
- **Confidence:** 80%
  - Implementation: 82% — Read git log for card file, parse commits, display in UI
  - Approach: 80% — Lightweight = last 10 commits; full history deferred
  - Impact: 78% — History view is nice-to-have; errors would hide history but not break core workflow
- **Acceptance:**
  - Card history section in card detail view
  - Displays: last 10 commits affecting card file, commit message, author, date
  - Link to full git log (external, e.g., GitHub) if repo URL configured
  - Performance: history load <200ms
- **Test plan:**
  - Unit: Mock git log output, verify parsing
  - Manual: Visual QA on card with history
  - Run: `pnpm --filter @apps/business-os test card-history`
- **Planning validation:**
  - Tests run: N/A (new code)
  - Test stubs written: N/A (S effort)
  - Unexpected findings: None
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - Git log parsing tested with various commit message formats
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Direct commit; optional UI component
  - Rollback: Git revert (UI only)
- **Documentation impact:**
  - None (UI feature; covered by app README)
- **Notes / references:**
  - Requirements line 297 mention "lightweight history"

### BOS-29: Create E2E tests for core workflows

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `apps/business-os/cypress/e2e/`, Cypress config (following repo pattern)
- **Depends on:** BOS-10, BOS-11, BOS-13
- **Confidence:** 85%
  - Implementation: 88% — Repo has both Cypress and Playwright; choosing Cypress to match CMS E2E pattern at `apps/cms/cypress.config.mjs`; examples in `test/e2e/` and `apps/cms/cypress/e2e/`
  - Approach: 85% — Follow existing Cypress pattern; temp git repo setup via Node.js `fs` API (repo precedent in `apps/cms/cypress.config.mjs` lines 49+)
  - Impact: 82% — E2E tests catch integration bugs; test isolation via temp directories reduces risk

#### Re-plan Update (2026-01-28)
- **Previous confidence:** 70%
- **Updated confidence:** 85%
  - Implementation: 88% — Repo uses **Cypress** (not Playwright as originally assumed); config at `apps/cms/cypress.config.mjs` (150+ lines); clear E2E test pattern
  - Approach: 85% — Follow `apps/cms` pattern: Cypress config, `test/e2e/` spec location, temp git repo via Node.js `mkdtempSync` + `cpSync` (lines 2-3 show precedent)
  - Impact: 82% — Tests isolated via temp directories; won't affect real `docs/business-os/`; failure doesn't corrupt prod data
- **Investigation performed:**
  - Repo: `apps/cms/cypress.config.mjs` (Cypress defineConfig, e2eSpecPattern, temp file operations)
  - Repo: `test/e2e/__tests__/login.spec.ts` (Cypress test example: `cy.visit`, `cy.get`, `cy.contains`)
  - Repo: `package.json` line `"e2e": "...cypress run --config-file apps/cms/cypress.config.mjs"` (execution pattern)
  - Discovery: Repo has both Playwright (`package.json:271`, `:341`) and Cypress; CMS app uses Cypress extensively for E2E
- **Decision / resolution:**
  - Use **Cypress** over Playwright to match existing CMS E2E patterns (reduce tooling fragmentation; reuse CMS config patterns)
  - Config file: `apps/business-os/cypress.config.mjs` (follow `apps/cms` pattern)
  - Test location: `apps/business-os/cypress/e2e/workflows.cy.ts` (Cypress convention: `.cy.ts` suffix)
  - Temp git repo setup: Use Node.js `fs.mkdtempSync`, `fs.cpSync` to create isolated `docs/business-os/` in OS temp dir; cleanup after test
  - Seed data: Copy minimal test fixtures (sample businesses.json, 1-2 raw ideas) to temp repo before tests run
- **Changes to task:**
  - Affects: Changed from `Playwright config` to `Cypress config` (apps/business-os/cypress.config.mjs)
  - Affects: Changed from `tests/e2e/` to `cypress/e2e/` (Cypress convention)
  - Acceptance: Updated config filename and test suffix (`.cy.ts` not `.spec.ts`)
  - Test plan: Updated run command to use Cypress
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - Temp git repo teardown strategy confirmed (cleanup on test failure vs. success)
  - Seed data fixtures created (example businesses.json, raw idea templates)

### BOS-30: Documentation: Business OS charter

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `docs/business-os/business-os-charter.md`
- **Depends on:** BOS-01
- **Confidence:** 88%
  - Implementation: 90% — Charter doc follows template; content derived from requirements
  - Approach: 88% — Charter provides high-level map; links to contracts and plans
  - Impact: 85% — Documentation only; errors would confuse onboarding but not break system
- **Acceptance:**
  - Charter doc: `docs/business-os/business-os-charter.md` with Type: Charter, Status: Canonical
  - Sections: Goals, Core flows, Key contracts (link to this plan), Out of scope
  - Primary code entrypoints: `apps/business-os/`, `docs/business-os/`
  - Charter linked from `docs/index.md` and `AGENTS.md`
- **Test plan:**
  - Manual: Review charter for completeness and clarity
  - Run: `pnpm docs:lint` (no errors)
- **Planning validation:**
  - Tests run: N/A (documentation)
  - Test stubs written: N/A (S effort)
  - Unexpected findings: None
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - User review: confirm charter covers all critical concepts
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Direct commit; documentation only
  - Rollback: Git revert
- **Documentation impact:**
  - Primary: `docs/business-os/business-os-charter.md` (this task)
  - Secondary: Update `docs/index.md` to link charter
- **Notes / references:**
  - Follow Charter template from `docs/AGENTS.docs.md` lines 114-140

### BOS-31: Documentation: Agent workflow guide for Business OS

- **Type:** IMPLEMENT
- **Affects:** `docs/business-os/agent-workflows.md`
- **Depends on:** BOS-21, BOS-22, BOS-23, BOS-24, BOS-25
- **Confidence:** 85%
  - Implementation: 88% — Workflow guide compiles skill instructions; straightforward
  - Approach: 85% — Guide structure follows existing agent guides
  - Impact: 82% — Documentation only; errors would confuse agents but Pete reviews output
- **Acceptance:**
  - Workflow guide: `docs/business-os/agent-workflows.md`
  - Sections: Overview, skill summaries (/work-idea, /propose-lane-move, /scan-repo, /update-business-plan, /update-people), examples, troubleshooting
  - Linked from `docs/agents/feature-workflow-guide.md`
  - Linked from Business OS charter
- **Test plan:**
  - Manual: Review guide for completeness
  - Run: `pnpm docs:lint` (no errors)
- **Planning validation:**
  - Tests run: N/A (documentation)
  - Test stubs written: N/A (M effort; stubs optional)
  - Unexpected findings: None
- **What would make this ≥90%:**
  - Agent test run: Pete runs each skill following guide, verifies instructions correct
- **Rollout / rollback:**
  - Rollout: Direct commit; documentation only
  - Rollback: Git revert
- **Documentation impact:**
  - Primary: `docs/business-os/agent-workflows.md` (this task)
  - Secondary: Update `docs/agents/feature-workflow-guide.md` to link Business OS workflows
- **Notes / references:**
  - Follow guide structure from `docs/agents/feature-workflow-guide.md`

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** Git conflicts from concurrent writes (Phase 0 single writer mitigates; still need retry logic)
  - Mitigation: Atomic operations with pull-commit-push cycle + exponential backoff retry (BOS-10)
- **Risk:** Incorrect path authorization could expose/block wrong files
  - Mitigation: Unit tests for all permission scenarios; manual penetration test before launch (BOS-09)
- **Risk:** Missing stage docs break UI assumptions
  - Mitigation: Always-on stage doc creation enforced at lane transition (BOS-19)
- **Risk:** Cycle detection bug could allow infinite dependency loops
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive unit tests with complex cycle scenarios; DFS algorithm review (BOS-20)
- **Risk:** Agent skills create malformed cards/plans
  - Mitigation: Zod validation on all writes; Pete reviews agent outputs in Phase 0; docs:lint catches errors
- **Risk:** Git library choice (BOS-18) affects performance/portability
  - Mitigation: Decision task with trade-off analysis; migration path documented if library swap needed
- **Risk:** E2E tests (BOS-29) are complex and may be flaky
  - Mitigation: Isolated test environment (temp git repo); retry logic on transient failures
- **Risk:** UI performance degrades with 100+ cards on board
  - Mitigation: Pagination or virtual scrolling (deferred to Phase 1; Phase 0 assumes <50 cards)
- **Risk:** Repo size grows with many archived items and scan history
  - Mitigation: Manual cleanup strategy documented; automated pruning deferred to Phase 1

## Observability

- **Logging:**
  - All repo write operations: log file path, commit hash, author, timestamp
  - Authorization failures: log user, attempted path, reason for denial
  - Agent skill runs: log skill name, inputs, outputs, duration
  - Git operation failures: log command, error, retry attempts
- **Metrics:**
  - Repo write operations per minute (detect concurrent write storms)
  - Authorization denial rate (detect misconfiguration or attacks)
  - Agent skill success/failure rate
  - Card state transitions per day (measure throughput)
- **Alerts/Dashboards:**
  - Phase 0: local dev only; no production alerts needed
  - Future: Cloudflare Pages deployment logs; Sentry error tracking

## Decision Log

- 2026-01-28: Chose Option A (docs taxonomy integration) over Option B (separate validation) for Phase 0 — aligns with existing `pnpm docs:lint` infrastructure; reduces tooling fragmentation
- 2026-01-28: Chose Option 2 (always-on stage docs) over Option 1 (optional stage docs) — reduces conditional logic in UI; ensures evidence trail always present
- 2026-01-28: PLAT treated as normal business code (no special priority) — simplifies dependency logic; aligns with requirements update
- 2026-01-28: BOS-18 resolved — chose isomorphic-git (Option A) over simple-git/nodegit — pure JS with no native deps; best fit for Phase 0 simplicity + portability; acceptable performance for expected scale (<100 cards). Note: Library choice alone insufficient to raise BOS-10 confidence; deployment runtime and governance must be resolved first.
- 2026-01-28: Re-plan complete (initial) — investigated 10 low-confidence tasks; BOS-06 resolved (100%); others raised to ≥82%. Key findings: docs:lint at `scripts/src/docs-lint.ts`, repo has both Cypress and Playwright (chose Cypress for consistency), agent skills follow `.claude/skills/` pattern.
- 2026-01-28: Re-plan corrections (post-review) — identified critical repo-truth failures and architectural risks. Added 4 new DECISION/IMPLEMENT tasks (BOS-00-A/B/C/D) as blockers. BOS-10 confidence reduced from 85% to 45% (blocked by deployment runtime and governance decisions). Overall confidence reduced from 86% to 52% (honest assessment of critical path blockers). Fixed false claims: gray-matter (repo has own parser), Playwright exists (chose Cypress for pattern consistency), removed false validation statements (app doesn't exist yet). Status: Draft (not Active; not ready for build until blockers resolved).
- 2026-01-28: Second corrections pass (addressing internal inconsistencies) — Fixed contradictory task statuses between table and sections. BOS-00-A reduced from "100% Complete" to "40% Needs-Input" (hosted writable checkout mechanism unproven). Added 2 missing critical blockers: BOS-00-E (auth mechanism choice, 0%), BOS-00-F (Node vs Edge runtime, 0%). BOS-10 further reduced to 30% (added BOS-00-F blocker; 4 existential blockers total). Overall changed from "52%" to "Blocked (0%)" (effort-weighted misleading when critical path blocked). Fixed downstream task statuses (BOS-13, 19, 27, 29 now Blocked). Updated requirements constraint to reflect unresolved conflict ("commits directly to main" contradicts AGENTS.md:55). Decision log cleaned of contradictions. Total blockers: 4 (BOS-00-A 40%, BOS-00-B 0%, BOS-00-E 0%, BOS-00-F 0%).
- 2026-01-28: BOS-00-B resolved (governance exception) — User decision: "An exception needs to be made for this app." Mechanism: Use existing auto-PR workflow (`.github/workflows/auto-pr.yml`). App commits to `work/business-os-*` branches → auto-PR creates PR with "zero-touch" label → auto-merge after CI passes. Preserves audit trail, rollback capability, and aligns with repo governance philosophy while enabling automated writes. Confidence: 100% complete.
- 2026-01-28: BOS-00-E resolved (no auth for Phase 0) — User decision: "No auth for p0." Mechanism: Local-only trust model. App assumes single trusted user (Pete); no login or session management required. Hardcode identity as `{name: "Pete", isPete: true}` for authorization checks. Migration to full auth required for Phase 1+ hosted deployment. Confidence: 100% complete.
- 2026-01-28: BOS-00-F resolved (Node runtime) — Recommendation accepted (implicit). Decision: Node runtime for all git/filesystem routes. Add `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` to API routes touching git/fs. Required for fs, isomorphic-git, and child_process (all unavailable in Edge runtime). Follows repo pattern from `apps/cms/src/app/api/cart/route.ts:10`, `apps/cms/src/app/api/media/route.ts:12`, `apps/brikette/src/app/api/guides/bulk-translation-status/route.ts:10`. Confidence: 100% complete.
- 2026-01-28: Major blockers resolved — BOS-00-B, BOS-00-E, BOS-00-F complete. BOS-10 unblocked: confidence increased from 30% to 70% (build-eligible). Downstream tasks unblocked: BOS-13, BOS-19, BOS-27, BOS-29 status changed from Blocked to Pending. Overall plan confidence recalculated from "Blocked (0%)" to 82% (effort-weighted across 37 tasks). Remaining partial blocker: BOS-00-A at 40% (hosted deployment mechanism unproven; acceptable for Phase 0 local-only).
