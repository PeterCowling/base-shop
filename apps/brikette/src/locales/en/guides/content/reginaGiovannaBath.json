  "intro": [
    "Bagni della Regina Giovanna is a collapsed sea cave on the Sorrento peninsula where clear water flows into a sheltered natural pool. There are no beach clubs or snack bars here — just limestone cliffs, emerald shallows, and photo-friendly arches.",
    "Use this guide to reach the cove by public bus, pack like a local, and make the most of the swimming ledges before looping back through Sorrento for food."

        "The Roman villa ruins above the pool frame turquoise water that funnels in from the sea through a natural arch. Arrive early and you can float beneath the cliffs with only a handful of locals for company.",
        "Unlike Positano’s lidos this spot is free year-round. Bring everything you need and be ready to scramble over rocks — the reward is a dramatic swimming hole that photographs beautifully at golden hour."

      "body": [
        "From Hostel Brikette, ride the SITA bus to Sorrento and connect with local bus line A or C (operated by EAV). Ask for \"Capo di Sorrento\" or \"Regina Giovanna\" so the driver knows you plan to hop off near the trailhead.",
        "The stop is about 15 minutes from Sorrento’s station. Follow Via Capo until you see signs for \"Bagni della Regina Giovanna\" and take the paved lane downhill. Allow 10 minutes to reach the ruins and another five to descend the stone steps into the cove.",
        "Return buses run roughly every 30 minutes until early evening; keep an eye on the posted timetable and plan to be back at the road before sunset."

        "Wear sturdy shoes for the rocky trail and bring water shoes for the slippery ledges. A lightweight towel and dry bag make it easier to keep belongings out of the spray.",
        "In peak summer add sunscreen, a hat, and at least 1.5 litres of water per person — there is little shade once the sun clears the cliffs."

        "The pool is deep enough for confident swimmers, but there is no formal ladder. Enter slowly using the natural rock shelves and avoid diving unless you have checked the depth yourself.",
        "Locals sometimes jump from the arch at high tide; only follow their lead if the sea is calm and you are comfortable with the height. Otherwise, float inside the pool and climb over to the sea-facing side for broader views.",
        "After storms the access steps can be slick with algae. Move carefully and consider gloves if you rely on the handrail for balance."

        "If you stay for sunset, give yourself 20 minutes to climb back to the bus stop and catch the ride into town. Trains and ferries back towards Naples and the Amalfi Coast thin out after 20:30, so check onward schedules before you linger."
