<h1>Startup Loop: What to do next for HEAD, PET, and BRIK</h1>
<h2>1) Purpose</h2>
<p>This page tells you what to do next for HEAD, PET, and BRIK — and how to do it.</p>
<h2>Open tasks (updated 2026-02-17)</h2>
<p>Use these ranked lists to pick your next action. Tasks are ordered — complete from top to bottom, as each one unlocks the next.</p>
<h3>HEAD</h3>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Fill Operational Confirmations (6 fields): in-stock date, units, pricing, compatibility, payment readiness, returns SLA</td>
<td>Nothing else for HEAD can advance until these are confirmed. The forecast, offer design, and channel selection all depend on known inventory and operational reality.</td>
<td>All 6 fields confirmed and timestamped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Complete Pre-website Measurement Setup</td>
<td>HEAD is pre-website. Paid traffic without GA4, Search Console, and conversion event setup produces data you cannot use.</td>
<td>Measurement setup document at Active status.</td>

<td>3</td>
<td>Produce the HEAD offer artifact (S2B)</td>
<td>Requires the operational inputs from task 1. Without the offer, the forecast and channel plan have no anchor.</td>
<td>Offer artifact exists with target customer profile, positioning, and pricing model.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<h2>The Loop in 8 steps</h2>
<p>Every week you run the same eight steps — gather data, design your offer, forecast, prioritise, act, then review — so the business gets sharper each time round.</p>
<pre class="mermaid">flowchart LR
    N1["Setup<br/>(S0–S1)"]
    N2["Research<br/>(S2)"]
    N3["Offer Design<br/>(S2B)"]
    N4["Forecast + Channels<br/>(S3/S6B)"]
    N5["Prioritise<br/>(S4–S5)"]
    N6["Pick top actions<br/>(S5A)"]
    N7["Execute<br/>(S7–S9B)"]
    N8["Weekly review<br/>(S10)"]
    NEND["End"]

    N1 --> N2
    N2 --> N3
    N3 --> N4
    N4 --> N5
    N5 --> N6
    N6 --> N7
    N7 --> N8

    N8 -->|Continue| N2
    N8 -->|Scale| N5
    N8 -->|Kill| NEND</pre>
<p>Each week the S10 review gives you one of three verdicts: Continue (loop back to Research and sharpen your data), Scale (jump straight to Prioritise with what you already know), or Kill (end the business and move on). The loop is designed to be fast — most businesses complete the full first pass in 2–4 weeks.</p>
<h2>Tasks by theme</h2>
<p>The same open tasks as above, grouped by type for when you want to tackle one theme across all three businesses at once.</p>
<h3>Measurement setup</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>HEAD</strong> — Complete Pre-website Measurement Setup (GA4 + Search Console + conversion events).</li>
<li><strong>PET</strong> — Complete Pre-website Measurement Setup (same requirement as HEAD).</li>
<li><strong>BRIK</strong> — Verify GA4 standard report signal: check begin_checkout and web_vitals in standard 7-day reports (not Realtime).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Operational confirmations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>HEAD</strong> — Fill Operational Confirmations: in-stock date, units, pricing, compatibility, payment flow readiness, returns SLA.</li>
<li><strong>PET</strong> — Confirm inventory inputs: units on hand, expected arrival date, landed cost per unit.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Acquisition data</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>PET</strong> — Run a 7-day paid acquisition test to capture the first measured CPC and CVR.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Forecasting</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>HEAD</strong> — Advance forecast to decision-grade once operational inputs are confirmed (rebuild the 12 Feb draft).</li>
<li><strong>PET</strong> — Advance forecast to decision-grade once inventory and acquisition data are captured (rebuild the 11 Feb draft).</li>
<li><strong>BRIK</strong> — Run day-14 forecast recalibration: replace seed assumptions with measured week 1/2 actuals.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Offer and channel design</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>HEAD</strong> — Produce offer artifact: target customer profile, positioning, pricing model.</li>
<li><strong>PET</strong> — Produce offer artifact: target customer profile, positioning, pricing model.</li>
<li><strong>BRIK</strong> — Produce offer artifact, then produce channel strategy (S6B) with 2-3 launch channels and a 30-day GTM plan.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Weekly cadence</h3>
<ul>
<li>Run the K/P/C/S decision for each business this week. Last completed: HEAD 12 Feb, PET 12 Feb, BRIK 13 Feb.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Standing refresh (cross-cutting)</h3>
<ul>
<li>No standing refresh documents exist yet for any business. Produce at minimum: one market-pulse document, one channel-economics-refresh document.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stage status</h2>
<p>When each stage was last completed per business. <strong>Draft</strong> means the artifact exists but is not yet decision-grade. <strong>Never</strong> means the stage has not been run. <strong>N/A</strong> means the stage does not apply to that business.</p>

<h2>Readiness check</h2>
<p>Before investing time in the next stage, answer these six questions. Each one is a yes/no check. A 'No' means you have work to do first — see the action cards above.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the offer defined clearly enough to test with real customers?</li>
<li>Is measurement set up and producing real data?</li>
<li>Do we have baseline data to compare against? <em>(existing businesses only — skip if you are pre-launch)</em></li>
<li>Do we have inventory and cost inputs to build a reliable forecast?</li>
<li>Have we chosen our 2–3 launch channels and do we have a plan for each?</li>
<li>Have we selected and scored the top 2–3 things to work on next?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Per-business action cards</h2>
<p>These cards tell you exactly what to do for each business. Each step is actionable — no code knowledge or repository access required.</p>
<h3>HEAD card</h3>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Confirm HEAD operations</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The HEAD 90-day forecast cannot become decision-grade until six operational inputs are confirmed. Without them, any planning and investment decision rests on assumptions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Confirm the in-stock date — when will the product physically be available to ship?</li>
<li>Confirm sellable units — how many units are available at launch?</li>
<li>Confirm pricing and any bundle options.</li>
<li>Provide the compatibility matrix — which devices/platforms does the product work with?</li>
<li>Confirm the payment flow is ready to accept orders.</li>
<li>Define the returns policy and SLA (how long does a return take?).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Done when:</strong> All six fields are filled in and timestamped. The Operational Confirmations form shows complete status.</p>
<hr>
<h3>PET card</h3>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Confirm PET supply and run first acquisition test</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The PET forecast is not decision-grade without real inventory data and at least one measured acquisition data point. Seed assumptions are not enough to make a confident investment decision.</p>
<ol>
<li>Confirm inventory units — how many units are on hand or on order?</li>
<li>Confirm the expected arrival date for the inventory.</li>
<li>Confirm the landed cost per unit (total cost including shipping, duties, and fees).</li>
<li>Run a small paid acquisition test for 7 days (any channel — Meta, Google, TikTok).</li>
<li>Record the observed cost per click (CPC) and conversion rate (CVR) from the test.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Done when:</strong> All inventory inputs confirmed. First measured CPC and CVR captured. Forecast document updated to decision-grade.</p>
<hr>
<h3>BRIK card</h3>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Restore GA4 measurement signal</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The weekly BRIK decision loop depends on non-zero signal from two GA4 events (begin_checkout and web_vitals) in standard 7-day reports. If these show zero, the weekly cadence cannot produce reliable data.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Google Analytics 4 → go to Standard Reports (NOT the Realtime section).</li>
<li>Navigate to Engagement → Events.</li>
<li>Set the date range to the last 7 days.</li>
<li>Check whether begin_checkout shows a non-zero count.</li>
<li>Check whether web_vitals shows a non-zero count.</li>
<li>If either is zero: open GA4 DebugView, open a live browser session on the site, and check whether the events fire during a real checkout attempt.</li>
<li>Document your findings — what you saw and whether it resolved.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Done when:</strong> Non-zero begin_checkout and web_vitals confirmed in standard 7-day GA4 report. Document saved. Then proceed to the day-14 forecast recalibration.</p>
<h2>If you have 10/30/60 minutes</h2>
<p>Already familiar with the loop? Use this guide to decide what to work on today based on the time you have.</p>
<h3>10 minutes — Check status and pick one action</h3>
<ul>
<li>Read the Today panel for the business you want to move forward.</li>
<li>Identify the single top blocker.</li>
<li>Complete one concrete step toward that blocker: fill a field in the Operational Confirmations form, run a 5-minute GA4 check, or confirm one inventory number.</li>
<li>Done: you have moved at least one blocker forward.</li>
</ul>
<h3>30 minutes — Complete a full checklist</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pick one of these and run it end-to-end:
<ul>
<li><strong>GA4 measurement verification for BRIK</strong> — open Standard Reports, check begin_checkout and web_vitals for last 7 days, run DebugView if needed, document outcome.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Confirmations for HEAD or PET</strong> — fill all 6 required fields in the form and timestamp them.</li>
<li><strong>Baseline refresh review</strong> — check whether any standing refresh prompt (market pulse, channel economics) is overdue and queue it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Done: the chosen checklist is complete and documented.</li>
</ul>
<h3>60 minutes — Produce a required artifact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pick one of these artifacts and produce it:
<ul>
<li><strong>Day-14 forecast recalibration</strong> — update the BRIK 90-day forecast using measured week-1/2 actuals to replace seed assumptions.</li>
<li><strong>Weekly K/P/C/S decision</strong> — run the weekly Keep/Pivot/Scale/Kill review for HEAD, PET, or BRIK and produce the decision document.</li>
<li><strong>Complete action card</strong> — pick one business, work through all steps in its action card, and mark it done.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Done: the artifact exists and is dated today.</li>

<h2>Deep Research Gate (S2 + S6) [Engineering Reference]</h2>
<h3>9.1 Mandatory hand-off rule</h3>
<p>When either S2 (market intelligence) or S6 (site-upgrade brief) is in a seed/draft state, the workflow must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop progression for that business at the affected stage.</li>
<li>Hand the user a ready-to-run Deep Research prompt file (not a template with placeholders).</li>
<li>Require Deep Research completion and persistence before continuing downstream stages.</li>
</ol>
<p>Seed/draft trigger conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>latest.user.md</code> is <code>Missing</code>, or</li>
<li><code>latest.user.md</code> points to a source doc with <code>Status: Draft</code>, or</li>
<li>source doc is stale (<code>Last-reviewed</code> older than 30 days), or</li>
<li>major outcome/ICP/channel/product change occurred.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional existing-business trigger:</p>
<ul>
<li>For <code>website-live</code> businesses, if S2A historical baseline is missing, <code>Draft</code>, or <code>Blocked</code>, S2/S6 must remain blocked.</li>
<li>If S2A result is <code>Blocked</code> due to missing data, hand the user an S2A data-request prompt immediately and pause until data is supplied.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pre-website measurement trigger:</p>
<ul>
<li>For <code>pre-website</code> businesses, S2 onward should be treated as <code>warning</code> quality unless S1B measurement bootstrap output exists and its verification checklist has passed.</li>
<li>If S1B output is missing, hand the user the S1B measurement-bootstrap prompt immediately and pause paid-traffic launch planning until completed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.2 Required operator hand-off message</h3>
<pre><code class="language-text">Deep Research completion is required for {{BIZ}} at stage {{S2|S6}}.

Use this ready-to-run prompt file:
{{PROMPT_FILE_PATH}}

Run Deep Research, then save/replace target output:
{{TARGET_OUTPUT_PATH}}

After saving:
1) Ensure output doc is decision-grade and set Status: Active.
2) Update latest pointer (`latest.user.md`) with source path.
3) Render HTML companion:

<h2>Operator Interface [Engineering Reference]</h2>
<p>Startup Loop needs a single operator interaction pattern so users do not guess the next step.
Canonical chat wrapper skill: <code>.claude/skills/startup-loop/SKILL.md</code>.</p>
<h3>13.1 Command-style interaction contract</h3>
<p>Use this command pattern in agent chat:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>/startup-loop start --business &#x3C;BIZ> --mode &#x3C;dry|live> --launch-surface &#x3C;pre-website|website-live></code></li>

<h3>13.3 Advance rule</h3>
<p>A stage is considered complete only when both are true:</p>
<ol>
<li>Required artifact is written and valid.</li>
<li>Required Business OS sync actions are confirmed complete.</li>
</ol>
<p>If either is missing, the run stays <code>blocked</code> at current stage.</p>
<p><strong>Brand gates enforced on advance (see <code>.claude/skills/startup-loop/SKILL.md</code> for full gate definitions):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GATE-BD-01</strong> (Hard): S1 advance blocked until <code>brand-dossier.user.md</code> exists at Draft minimum in strategy index.</li>
<li><strong>GATE-BD-03</strong> (Hard): S2B completion blocked until <code>messaging-hierarchy.user.md</code> exists at Draft minimum in strategy index.</li>
<li><strong>GATE-BD-08</strong> (Soft — warning only): S10 emits a staleness warning if brand-dossier <code>Last-reviewed</code> > 90 days.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Business OS Sync Contract (No Loop-to-BOS Drift) [Engineering Reference]</h2>
<p>Startup Loop artifacts and Business OS state must move together.</p>
<h3>14.1 Write-path rule</h3>
<p>For cards, ideas, and stage docs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canonical write path is Business OS UI/API (<code>/api/agent/*</code>) to D1.</li>
<li>Do not treat markdown mirror under <code>docs/business-os/cards/</code> and <code>docs/business-os/ideas/</code> as editable source-of-truth.</li>
