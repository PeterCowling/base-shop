# Critique History: startup-loop-launch-acceleration-gap-fill

## Round 1 — 2026-02-24

### Issues Opened This Round
| ID | Severity | Target | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1-01 | Major | Evidence Audit | Stale capability-status evidence from 2026-02-17 was not explicitly labeled as stale. |
| 1-02 | Moderate | Frontmatter | Repository metadata alignment gap: `Last-reviewed` and `Relates-to` were absent. |

### Issues Confirmed Resolved This Round
| Prior ID | Severity | Summary | How resolved |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1-01 | Major | Stale evidence labels missing | Added explicit stale markers to capability-status citations in Key Modules / Files. |
| 1-02 | Moderate | Metadata alignment gap | Added `Last-reviewed: 2026-02-24` and `Relates-to: docs/business-os/startup-loop/loop-spec.yaml` to frontmatter. |

### Issues Carried Open (not yet resolved)
| Prior ID | Severity | Rounds Open | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| None | — | — | None |

### Round Verdict
- Verdict: `credible`
- Score: `4.4/5.0`
- Notes: Evidence chain is strong and planning-ready; remaining uncertainty is implementation execution risk, already reflected in confidence inputs.

## Round 2 — 2026-02-24

### Issues Opened This Round
| ID | Severity | Target | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2-01 | Major | Discovery Coverage | Conversation-derived gap discovery path was not explicitly modeled, despite being a core acceleration requirement. |
| 2-02 | Moderate | External Research | Comparable system patterns (CASS/cass-memory/meta_skill) were not yet captured as evidence-backed transfer inputs. |

### Issues Confirmed Resolved This Round
| Prior ID | Severity | Summary | How resolved |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2-01 | Major | Conversation-derived discovery missing | Added transcript-mining gap row, canonical output artifact proposal, and open decision on transcript sources/retention. |
| 2-02 | Moderate | External pattern evidence missing | Added dedicated external research section with repository-backed pattern extraction and explicit transfer note. |

### Issues Carried Open (not yet resolved)

### Round Verdict
- Verdict: `credible`
- Score: `4.6/5.0`
- Notes: Fact-find now covers both internal gap evidence and a concrete conversation-mining discovery lane with external pattern grounding.

## Round 3 — 2026-02-24

### Issues Opened This Round
| ID | Severity | Target | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3-01 | Critical | Prioritization | Matrix lacked quantitative tradeoff model and ordered first-wave execution list. |
| 3-02 | Major | Reproducibility | Several evidence claims relied on manual/inferred scans without command-backed replay steps. |
| 3-03 | Critical | Signal Contracts | Proposed outputs lacked contract-ready path/schema/validator/consumer/freshness specification. |
| 3-04 | Major | Governance | Conversation-mining lane lacked transcript-source realism, privacy rules, retention policy, and no-raw-transcript boundary. |
| 3-05 | Major | Enforcement Semantics | Weekly packet enforcement direction lacked explicit advisory/soft/hard gate progression. |
| 3-06 | Moderate | Measurement Scope | Connector expansion risked overreach without minimum viable measurement criteria. |
| 3-07 | Moderate | Confidence Calibration | Confidence percentages had no explicit scoring rubric for re-evaluation. |
| 3-08 | Major | Risk Coverage | Missing explicit privacy/licensing/adoption-economics risks in risk table. |

### Issues Confirmed Resolved This Round
| Prior ID | Severity | Summary | How resolved |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3-01 | Critical | Quantitative prioritization missing | Added scored model fields, formula, adoption-economics guardrail, and ordered first-wave backlog with numeric ranking. |
| 3-02 | Major | Evidence reproducibility weak | Added reproducible command section with command lines and captured outputs for stage counts, transcript scans, artifact presence, weekly packet scans, and contract lint. |
| 3-03 | Critical | Signal contracts not implementation-ready | Added contract template and initial artifact contract table covering canonical path, schema fields, producer, validator hook, consumers, and freshness SLA. |
| 3-04 | Major | Conversation-mining governance unspecified | Added explicit source priorities (`~/.claude/projects`, `~/.codex/sessions`), privacy redaction rules, retention windows, and hard no-raw-transcript commit policy. |
| 3-05 | Major | Weekly enforcement lacked exceptions model | Added L0/L1/L2 enforcement ladder with promotion criteria that preserves phase-1 no-block posture. |
| 3-06 | Moderate | Connector expansion scope too broad | Added Minimum Viable Measurement principle with admissibility fields and top-two-source rollout rule. |
| 3-07 | Moderate | Confidence scoring non-reproducible | Added 1.0-5.0 rubric and dimension table with explicit score-to-percent conversion. |
| 3-08 | Major | Missing risk classes | Expanded risk table with transcript privacy/PII, external licensing dependency risk, and net-operator-minutes economics control. |

### Issues Carried Open (not yet resolved)
| Prior ID | Severity | Rounds Open | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| None | — | — | None |

### Round Verdict
- Verdict: `ready-for-plan`
- Score: `4.9/5.0`
- Notes: Fact-find now has a contractable first-wave execution packet with quantified ordering, replayable evidence, governance boundaries, and measurable pilot success criteria.
