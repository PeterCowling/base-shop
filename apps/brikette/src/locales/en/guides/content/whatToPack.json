  "intro": [
    "The Amalfi Coast's dramatic stairs, seasonal weather, and Mediterranean sun shape what you should pack. This guide covers essentials for Positano and surrounding towns, with seasonal variations and practical costs for buying items locally.",
    "**Key packing principles:** Prioritize comfortable walking shoes (stairs are everywhere), sun protection year-round, and layers for temperature changes between coastal and hillside areas.",
    "**Luggage tip:** Backpacks and soft-sided bags handle stairs better than wheeled suitcases. If staying at Hostel Brikette or other hillside locations, you'll climb 100+ steps with your luggage. See our %LINK:checkinCheckout|check-in and arrival guide% for more details on getting to the hostel with bags."

        "The Amalfi Coast has four distinct seasons. Here's what to adjust for each:",
        "**Spring (March–May):** Pack layers — mornings can be cool (12–15°C / 54–59°F), afternoons warm (18–22°C / 64–72°F). Bring a light rain jacket; April showers are common. Sunscreen is essential even in spring.",
        "**Summer (June–September):** Hot and dry (25–32°C / 77–90°F). Lightweight, breathable clothing is critical. Pack a hat, sunglasses, and high-SPF sunscreen. Evenings stay warm, but bring one light layer for air-conditioned restaurants. This is peak season — expect crowds and higher prices.",
        "**Fall (October–November):** Similar to spring but wetter. Pack waterproof shoes and a compact umbrella. Ocean stays swimmable through October. Temperatures range 15–23°C / 59–73°F.",
        "**Winter (December–February):** Mild but rainy (8–15°C / 46–59°F). You'll need a proper rain jacket, warm layers, and closed-toe shoes with good grip for wet stairs. Many beach clubs close, but hiking is excellent in winter."

        "**Essential: Walking shoes with grip** — Sneakers or hiking shoes with good tread for stairs and coastal paths. Avoid smooth-soled dress shoes or fashion sneakers with flat soles — polished stone steps are slippery, especially when wet.",
        "**Beach footwear** — Water shoes or sturdy sandals with straps (not flip-flops). Beaches here are often pebbly, and some require walking on rocks to enter the water. Check our %LINK:positanoBeaches|Positano beaches guide% for details on each beach's terrain.",
        "**Evening shoes (optional)** — If you want to dress up for dinner, bring one pair of smarter shoes, but make sure they still have grip for walking home on stairs.",
        "**What to skip:** Heels (dangerous on stairs), pure flip-flops (uncomfortable for long walks), brand-new shoes (break them in before arriving)."

      "question": "What's the best luggage for Positano?",
      "answer": "A backpack or soft-sided duffel bag is ideal. If staying at hillside locations like Hostel Brikette, you'll climb 100+ stairs with your luggage. Rolling suitcases are difficult on stairs and cobblestones. Pack light — aim for carry-on size if possible."
