- Offer framing (ICP, promise, objection handling)
- Channel strategy (acquisition path, CTA language, trust framing)
- Product evidence (materials, compatibility, care, claims)
- Pricing/guarantee mechanics

3. Keep launch copy concise and reusable (homepage, PLP, PDP, social snippets).
4. Keep all copy traceable to a source path in this packet.
