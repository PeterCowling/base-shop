## Sitemaps

Each shop exposes `/sitemap.xml` generated by `src/app/sitemap.ts`. The route
collects all products from `products.json` and emits `hreflang` entries for
configured languages.

### Regenerating the sitemap

Sitemaps are rebuilt whenever the shop is deployed. To regenerate locally after
changing products or languages, run:

```
pnpm --filter @apps/<shop-id> build
```

Then request `http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml` to verify the output.
