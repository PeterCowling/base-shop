    "Praiano's Gavitella cove faces west, giving you long afternoon sun and golden-hour views back to Positano and Capri. Two lidos — La Gavitella and One Fire — share the small shoreline beside a compact public section carved into the rock.",
    "Expect a curated, reservation-driven experience: steep stairs limit crowds, the clubs coordinate boat shuttles, and evenings revolve around seafood dinners or DJ-led sunset parties."
