# Brikette Deferred Work Plan

## Context

This plan consolidates all deferred and blocked items from two completed brikette plans:

1. **Brikette Improvement Plan** — Phases 1–2 complete (type safety, error handling, component complexity, over-optimization, hardcoded guide logic). Phase 3 (performance) and Phase 4.2 (translation coverage) deferred.
2. **Brikette HTGH Content Fix Plan** — All code changes complete. Full build verification blocked by unrelated prerender issues.

## BRIK-DEF-01: Full Build Verification

**Priority:** P1
**Blocked by:** Unrelated prerender issues in the brikette app
**Origin:** brikette-htgh-content-fix-plan.md, Step 4
