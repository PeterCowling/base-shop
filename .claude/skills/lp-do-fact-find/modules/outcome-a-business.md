# Outcome A Module: Business Artifact Track

Use this module for `Outcome: planning` with `Execution-Track: business-artifact` (and the business side of `mixed`).

## Objective

Produce evidence that lets `/lp-do-plan` create validation-first, channel-aware business tasks.

## Required Evidence Slices

1. Audience and segmentation
- Who receives/uses the deliverable and why.

2. Channel and platform constraints
- Email/WhatsApp/ad/platform policy or operational constraints.
- Use official docs when policy claims matter.

3. Existing assets and operating baseline
- Current templates, examples, playbooks, and known performance baselines.

4. Ownership and approvals
- Who signs off, who executes, who measures.

5. Compliance and brand constraints
- Legal/privacy/contact-policy constraints and brand boundaries.

6. Measurement and decision hooks
- Metrics, attribution limits, and decision cadence after delivery.

7. Hypothesis and validation landscape
- Key hypotheses
- Existing signal coverage
- Falsifiability/cost/time to test
- Recommended validation approach (quick probe vs structured test vs deferred)

## Confidence Inputs (must justify each)

Provide numeric scores with evidence:
- Implementation
- Approach
- Impact
- Delivery-Readiness

For business-heavy work, Delivery-Readiness should explicitly cover owner + channel + approval + measurement availability.

## Output Section Requirements

Ensure these sections in the planning brief are filled (or explicitly marked not investigated):
- `## Evidence Audit (Current State)`
- `### Delivery & Channel Landscape`
- `### Hypothesis & Validation Landscape`
- `## Confidence Inputs`
- `## Risks`

## Mixed-Track Rule

If `Execution-Track: mixed`, pair this module with `outcome-a-code.md` and merge findings into one brief.

## Website-Upgrade Rule

If `Startup-Deliverable-Alias: website-upgrade-backlog`, stop and route to `outcome-a-website-upgrade.md` instead of this generic module.

## Website-First-Build Rule

If `Startup-Deliverable-Alias: website-first-build-backlog`, stop and route to `outcome-a-website-first-build.md` instead of this generic module.
