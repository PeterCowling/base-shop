# Facilella — Product Naming Spec (Round 1)

---

## 1. What this product name is for

**Brand:** Facilella — a coined Italian-register masterbrand. Selected R7, 2026-02-26. Domain: facilella.com (secured).

**Hero product:** A soft textile retention headband that keeps an external cochlear implant (CI) processor in place through a full day of school, play, and sport — without clinical framing. The headband is the launch SKU. Future SKUs include: organiser pouches, parts pods, identity patch packs, sport band variants.

**Naming pattern confirmed:** `Facilella [Line Name]` compound. Each product line is marketed as "Facilella [Line Name]" across PDPs, packaging, and marketplace listings. The **Line Name** is what this spec generates — not a standalone brand name, not a replacement for Facilella.

**Line Name requirements:**
- 1 word, 3–12 letters preferred (follows the 9-letter masterbrand; compound must remain legible)
- Pronounceable in Italian by a native speaker without coaching
- Works visually alongside the Facilella wordmark
- Starts with a consonant or open vowel (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`) — avoids clash with the trailing `-la` of Facilella

**Primary market:** Italy. Secondary: EU (French, Spanish, German speakers are secondary ICP). Line name must not require translation to be emotionally legible to Italian primary buyer.

---

## 2. Brand context

**Brand personality:** Reassuring, practical, approachable, inclusive, warm. Not clinical, not spa/wellness, not corporate.

**Brand register:** Lifestyle accessories / everyday carry. Analogous feel: Bellroy (functional warmth), Tula (child-facing practicality), Aer (everyday carry).

**Primary buyer (ICP-A):** Parent/caregiver of CI-wearing child aged 1–12 in Italy. Problem-aware, high-intent, practical. Not browsing — evaluating trust and fit. "Will it stay on? Can I trust this brand?"

**Secondary buyer (ICP-B):** Active teen/adult CI wearer (16–45). More style-aware; purchase more self-led.

**ICP resonance test (compound context):** Would an Italian parent on mobile scrolling a CI caregiver forum stop at "Facilella [Line Name]" and think "that looks like a product I'd trust for my child's kit" — in under 3 seconds? This is the primary pass/fail test for the I dimension.

---

## 3. Scoring rubric — DWPEIC (max 30)

**Score each dimension 1–5. Total = D + W + P + E + I + C.**

### D — Distinctiveness (as a Line Name element)
- **5:** Coined or highly suggestive word with low TM collision risk in Classes 25/26; strong ownability as a compound element
- **4:** Coined or suggestive with limited exposure; good TM position in context of Facilella compound
- **3:** Some uniqueness but phonetically crowded or near-generic in accessories register
- **2:** Generic or descriptive word likely to have TM conflicts in Classes 25/26
- **1:** Directly confusable with existing product lines, clinical terms, or brand names in the same category

### W — Wordmark quality (as Line Name following Facilella)
- **5:** 3–9 letters; strong visual rhythm after "Facilella"; clean in uppercase/lowercase; Etsy listing-friendly; handle-friendly
- **4:** Solid visual balance with minor constraints (slightly long or slightly short)
- **3:** Functional but visually unremarkable in the compound
- **2:** Too long, creates awkward compound (e.g., Facilella Quotidiana at 21 chars), or poor visual weight
- **1:** Weak wordmark in compound context — cluttered, illegible at small sizes, or confusing paired letter sequences

### P — Phonetic quality (Italian-first)
- **5:** Smooth in Italian; easy to say aloud as "Facilella [X]"; natural in Italian retail copy ("ho comprato la Facilella [X]"); no consonant cluster foreign to Italian
- **4:** Mostly smooth with one minor awkward phoneme or elision
- **3:** Pronounceable but requires coaching or feels odd in the compound
- **2:** Awkward in Italian; contains clusters Italian speakers would stumble over
- **1:** Hard to pronounce reliably in Italian; false cognate risk or register problem

### E — Line Extension headroom
- **5:** Works across all variant types — fabric variants (cotton, sport mesh, linen), colour variants, bundle variants (school kit, sport kit), and product adjacencies (pouches, pod organiser) — without implying any one specific configuration
- **4:** Works across most variants; one framing constraint (e.g., slightly skews one use case)
- **3:** Works for the core SKU; narrow headroom for variant extension
- **2:** Implies a specific feature that may not apply to all variants (e.g., a word meaning "sport" excludes everyday use)
- **1:** Locks the line name to one specific configuration or feature; no extension headroom

### I — ICP resonance in compound context (decision gate — see §3.1)
- **5:** "Facilella [X]" immediately trusted and emotionally resonant for Italian caregiver ICP — warm, practical, lifestyle; feels like a brand they'd follow and recommend in a CI forum
- **4:** On-tone and credible; clearly lifestyle, not clinical; caregiver would click through
- **3:** Neutral — neither strong trust nor strong rejection (**GATE FAIL — see §3.1**)
- **2:** Feels spa-like, clinical, craft-studio, or generic — caregiver scrolls past
- **1:** Actively wrong register — clinical, corporate, concealment-coded, or infantilising

### C — Category signal (cold buyer legibility)
- **5:** A cold Italian buyer (not in the CI community) understands from "Facilella [X]" that this is a headband or hair accessory product — no further context needed
- **4:** Category largely legible; minor ambiguity resolved by product photo
- **3:** Ambiguous — product category unclear without supporting copy or imagery
- **2:** Misleading — suggests a different product category (e.g., sounds like a bag, a cosmetic, or a service)
- **1:** Category-blind — gives no signal whatsoever about the product type

---

### 3.1 I hard gate

**Any candidate scoring I ≤ 3 is eliminated and must not appear in the output table, regardless of total score.**

Before assigning an I score, apply these tests in order:
1. **Spa/wellness test:** Does "Facilella [X]" sound like an Italian spa product, a herbal supplement, or a slow-living lifestyle brand? → I ≤ 2 → eliminate
2. **Clinical test:** Does "Facilella [X]" sound like a medical device accessory, a clinical retention system, or a therapeutic product? → I ≤ 2 → eliminate
3. **Compound scroll test:** Would an Italian CI caregiver parent on mobile stop at "Facilella [X]" and feel "that's a product for us"? If the honest answer is "probably not" → I = 3 → eliminate

---

## 4. Naming territories — 5 territories, 15 candidates each

### Pre-generation gate (territory integrity check)

Before generating, verify the five territories pass all three collapse tests:

**Test 1 — Probe generation:** Write 3 plausible Line Name candidates from each territory (15 total) using only that territory's word bank. Names must not share semantic root across territories.

**Test 2 — Swap test:** Attempt to relabel each probe name to a different territory. If any name fits equally well in two territories, tighten the word banks before generating.

**Test 3 — Brand test:** Treat each territory as a distinct product positioning. Are all 5 clearly distinct positions — different emotional register, different word choices? If two feel like the same position, separate them further.

---

#### Territory 1 — Italian Product-Type Words (functional category compounds)

**Situation anchor:** A parent sees "Facilella Cerchietto" on an Etsy listing — before clicking, before reading the description, they know exactly what the product is. The line name does the category work so the photo can do the conversion work.

**Semantic type:** Italian common nouns and diminutives for headbands, accessories, and head-worn items. Words that name the product category or form factor.

**Generates vocabulary like:** cerchietto (small hoop/headband), fascia (band/strip), nastro (ribbon/band), archetto (small arch/headband), cintura (belt/band), fiocco (bow/knot), nodo (knot/node), anello (ring/loop), cinto (tied/worn around)

**Banned from other territories:** cerchietto, fascia, archetto — these are category-specific and must not appear in T2/T3/T4/T5

**Registration constraint:** Category-descriptive Italian nouns (fascia, cerchietto) score lower on D (Distinctiveness) — this is expected and noted. The compound "Facilella Fascia" is still ownable in TM. High C scores offset lower D scores.

---

#### Territory 2 — Italian Benefit Words (what wearing it gives you)

**Situation anchor:** A parent at the end of the school run checks their child's processor — it is exactly where it was placed that morning. "Facilella [X]" delivered. The line name names the outcome, not the product.

**Semantic type:** Italian adjectives and short nouns expressing benefit states — security, stability, freedom, ease. Benefit, not product-type.

**Generates vocabulary like:** sicura (safe/secure, fem.), stabile (stable), libera (free, fem.), salda (firm/steady, fem.), ferma (firm/fixed, fem.), pronta (ready, fem.), salva (saved/safe, fem.), viva (alive/active — as in "full of life"), decisa (decisive/clear)

**Banned from other territories:** sicura, salda, ferma — benefit-state adjectives; do not import into T1/T3/T4/T5

**Register check:** Benefit words must feel lifestyle-positive, not medical or clinical. "Salva" could read clinical; if so, score I accordingly. Words like "stabile" are neutral-positive — acceptable.

---

#### Territory 3 — Italian Routine Words (everyday-ness)

**Situation anchor:** A child's morning routine: breakfast, brush teeth, put on shoes, put on Facilella — without thinking about it. The headband has become as unremarkable and essential as shoes. The line name signals routine, normalcy, habit.

**Semantic type:** Italian words about daily routine, ordinary habit, and belonging to the everyday — not special occasions, not medical moments.

**Generates vocabulary like:** giornata (day/daily experience), mattina (morning), quotidiana (daily, fem.), usuale (usual/customary), solita (usual/habitual, fem.), abitudine (habit), via (on the way/en route), andare (to go/going), subito (straight away — as in "done immediately"), sempre (always)

**Banned from other territories:** giornata, mattina, quotidiana — routine-time words; do not import into T1/T2/T4/T5

**Register check:** Must feel warm and normalising, not boring or dismissive. "Quotidiana" is slightly long (11 letters) — score W accordingly. Preferred: shorter routine words (5–8 letters).

---

#### Territory 4 — International/English Loan Words (familiar, globally legible)

**Situation anchor:** A parent is Etsy-browsing in English (or a French/German parent is looking for Italian-made CI accessories) — "Facilella Sport" or "Facilella Active" immediately reads as a product name. The line name uses vocabulary already present in Italian everyday speech as a loan word.

**Semantic type:** English-origin words already integrated into Italian consumer language — sport, active, everyday, daily, soft, fit, style. Not translations; genuinely used in Italian product naming and lifestyle copy.

**Generates vocabulary like:** Sport, Active, Everyday, Daily, Soft, Comfort, Fit, Slim, Style, Plus, Basic, Light, Play, Run, Go

**Banned from other territories:** Sport, Active — English loan words specific to lifestyle product positioning; do not import into T1/T2/T3/T5

**Register check:** English loan words in Italian product naming are normal (Nike, H&M, Bellroy all sell in Italy using English product-line names). But the word must feel genuinely integrated into Italian speech, not like an awkward anglicism. "Everyday" is borderline — scores W 3 (slightly foreign for an Italian-primary brand). "Sport" is fully integrated. Score accordingly.

---

#### Territory 5 — Coined/Poetic Italian Diminutives (warm invented or uncommon words)

**Situation anchor:** An Italian parent sees "Facilella Tenella" or "Facilella Girava" on a product card — it doesn't name a category or a benefit, but it feels warm, Italian, slightly playful without being childish, and distinctively "theirs." The line name is a coined or uncommon Italian word that sounds right before it means anything.

**Semantic type:** Coined Italian words, poetic diminutives, or uncommon real Italian words with warm aesthetic quality. The vocabulary of tender, functional Italian — words that feel grown-up but approachable. Not spa/wellness — not fiore, luce, morbido — but also not clinical or corporate.

**Generates vocabulary like (invented and uncommon):** tenella (coined — tender/held, fem.), girava (coined — turning/going), vela (sail — uncommon in accessories), posa (resting position), trova (finds/found), cura (care — borderline spa, score carefully), segna (marks/signals), svelta (quick/nimble, fem.), desta (alert/awake, fem.), salma (calmer form — borderline spa, careful scoring), preda (catches — unusual, fem.), mira (aim/target — directional)

**Banned from other territories:** tenella, girava, posa — coined or poetic words; do not import into T1/T2/T3/T4

**Register check:** The spa/wellness failure test is most dangerous here. Before scoring I, apply the spa/wellness test explicitly. Words like "cura" (care) and "salma" (calm) often score I = 2 in this context. Only include words where "Facilella [X]" clearly reads lifestyle accessories, not Italian wellness brand.

---

## 5. Pattern pools

### 5.1 Pattern A — Meaning-anchored morpheme combinations

Draw both morpheme elements from the same territory. The compound must carry semantic weight — both elements should point to the same territory's word bank. Only cross-territory blends where both elements pass the I hard gate independently.

**Allowed:** Italian morpheme pairs from territory word banks. Both elements must be short (2–4 syllables combined). Result must be pronounceable.

**Blocked (Pattern D equivalents):** Any compound using compound-category suffixes (-arte, -cura, -studio, -care, -soft, -comfort, -kit, -co) — these create compound-domain register that undermines the masterbrand positioning.

### 5.2 Pattern B — Existing Italian words (real vocabulary)

Real Italian words from territory word banks and their semantic neighbourhood. Must feel like lifestyle accessories vocabulary, not spa/wellness/craft vocabulary.

**Blocked from all Pattern B:**
- Spa/wellness register: calma, morbida, seta, nido, brezza, piuma, trama, tela, filo, fiore, dolce, velluto, carezza, luce (standalone), alba, sera, brezza, candela, rima, fiamma, profumo, incanto — any word primarily associated with Italian spa/wellness/artisan-craft branding
- Medical/clinical register: hear, sound, restore, therapy, cure, treatment, rehabilitation, clinical, medical, cochlear, implant, device, processor (in the mark itself)
- Concealment register: nascosto, invisibile, discreto, segreto — any word that implies the headband conceals the device

### 5.3 Pattern C — Fragment blends from territory word banks

Blend fragments (2–4 letters each) from the same territory's word bank. Each fragment must point to a specific territory word, not be a random syllable. Result must be pronounceable in Italian.

**Examples of legitimate blends:** `sic-` (from sicura) + `-ella` → "Sicella" (T2). `gio-` (from giornata) + `-vella` → "Giovella" (T3, invented).

**Blocked:** Purely phonetic blends with no semantic territory connection — these will score I ≤ 3 by definition (no emotional anchor → eliminate at I gate).

### 5.4 Pattern E — English loan words (Territory 4 only)

Real English words already used in Italian consumer/lifestyle product naming. Short, clean, internationally legible. No respelling needed — the word as-is is the line name.

**See Territory 4 word bank.** Only words genuinely used in Italian product naming are valid Pattern E candidates.

---

## 6. Hard blockers and elimination rules

### 6.1 Hard blockers — any single failure eliminates the candidate

**EU MDR vocabulary ban (strict — hard stop):**
The following words and their Italian equivalents must not appear in the line name or the compound "Facilella [X]":
- improve hearing, therapy, treatment, rehabilitation, restore hearing, clinical
- cochlear (in the name itself), implant, processor (in the name), device (in the name)
- "enables your processor to work", "essential for implant function"
- Any claim about hearing outcomes

**Concealment register ban:**
- hide, invisible, discreet, conceal, nascosto, invisibile, discreto, segreto
- Any word whose primary association is hiding or minimising the CI device

**Spa/wellness/craft register ban:**
- calma, morbida, seta, nido, brezza, piuma, trama, tela, filo, fiore, dolce, velluto, carezza, luce (standalone), alba, sera, brezza, candela, rima, fiamma, profumo, incanto
- Any Italian word primarily associated with spa/wellness/artisan-craft branding

**Infantilisation ban:**
- Avoid diminutives with `-ino/-ina` suffix — the brand targets adult caregivers making considered purchases; infantilising line names undermine trust
- Exception: if a word naturally carries `-ina` as part of its standard Italian form (e.g., "mattina") it is acceptable

**Compound phonetic constraint:**
- The line name must begin with a consonant or open vowel (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`)
- Beginning with `l` creates "Facilella L..." which has harsh elision with the trailing `-la`
- Beginning with a complex consonant cluster (`str-`, `spl-`, `thr-`, `scr-`) fails the Italian pronunciation test

**I hard gate:**
- I ≤ 3 → candidate is eliminated regardless of other scores
- Apply spa/wellness test, clinical test, and compound scroll test before scoring I (see §3.1)

### 6.2 Seed candidates (ASSESSMENT-13 provisional)

The following 5 candidates from the existing ASSESSMENT-13 artifact carry forward as seeds. They are not pre-eliminated. Score them normally against DWPEIC — if they pass the I gate (I ≥ 4) they may appear in the output. Their territory assignments are noted:

| Seed | Territory | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Cerchietto | T1 (Italian Product-Type) | Category-descriptive; likely high C, lower D |
| Sicura | T2 (Italian Benefit) | Benefit-state; "safe/secure" — may score I ≥ 4 as warm and practical |
| Libera | T2 (Italian Benefit) | "Free" — aspirational framing; may score I = 3 (scroll test: functional buyer might not connect) |
| Everyday | T4 (English Loan) | Integrative; may score W = 3 for an Italian-primary brand |
| Sport | T4 (English Loan) | Narrow E (Line Extension headroom = 2 — only sport variant); may score I = 3 for the core everyday headband |

These seeds do not count toward the 75-candidate target. If any seed passes the I gate, it may appear in the table alongside the 75 generated candidates.

---

## 7. Anti-criteria (rejection tests before scoring)

Apply these tests in order before scoring any candidate. A single failure eliminates — do not score, do not include.

1. **EU MDR test:** Does the line name or the compound "Facilella [X]" use vocabulary that implies hearing improvement, therapeutic purpose, or device enabling? → eliminate
2. **Spa/wellness test:** Does "Facilella [X]" sound like an Italian spa brand, herbal supplement, slow-living blog, or artisan craft studio? → eliminate (I ≤ 2)
3. **I hard gate pre-screen:** Compound scroll test — would an Italian CI caregiver parent on mobile stop at "Facilella [X]" and feel "that's a product for us"? If probably not → eliminate (I = 3)
4. **Territory test:** Can you state which territory this line name belongs to in one sentence referencing a specific scene from that territory's situation anchor? If not → eliminate (likely I ≤ 3)
5. **Clinical test:** Does "Facilella [X]" sound like a medical device, retention system, or clinical accessory? → eliminate
6. **Concealment test:** Does the line name imply hiding or minimising the CI device? → eliminate
7. **Phonetic constraint test:** Does the line name start with `l` or a consonant cluster foreign to Italian (`str-`, `thr-`, `spl-`)? → eliminate
8. **Compound legibility test:** Is "Facilella [X]" 20 characters or more? If compound is too long for comfortable display on an Etsy listing title → score W = 1 → consider eliminating
9. **Infantilisation test:** Does the line name use an `-ino/-ina` diminutive that infantilises the compound? → eliminate (unless `-ina` is the word's standard Italian form, e.g., mattina)

---

## 8. Output format

Generate a markdown table with exactly these columns:

```
| # | Line Name | Full Compound | Pattern | Territory | Provenance note | D | W | P | E | I | C | Score |
```

**Provenance note format:** Two parts separated by ` — `:
1. Structural origin (e.g., "Italian noun: cerchietto — small hoop/headband", "coined blend: ten+ella", "English loan: Sport")
2. Territory tag (one of: `Italian Product-Type`, `Italian Benefit`, `Italian Routine`, `English Loan`, `Coined Diminutive`)

**Sort:** Score descending; ties by I descending, then alphabetically by Line Name.

**Target:** 75 candidates (excluding seeds). All have I ≥ 4. Territory distribution: T1: 15, T2: 15, T3: 15, T4: 15, T5: 15.

**After the table:** Write a one-paragraph summary covering: territory distribution across the 75 names, which territories produced the highest I scores, which pattern types proved most productive for DWPEIC, and any territory that came in below 13 names (flag for re-run).

---

## 9. Italian language notes

- **Phoneme rules for Italian:** Italian has no `th`, `w`, `j` sounds (except loan words). Consonant clusters allowed: `br`, `cr`, `dr`, `fr`, `gr`, `pr`, `tr`, `bl`, `cl`, `fl`, `gl`, `pl`, `sl`. Clusters to avoid in coined words: `str`, `spl`, `thr`, `rh`, `ck`.
- **Vowel-final words:** Italian words almost always end in a vowel — `-a`, `-e`, `-i`, `-o`. Consonant-final words feel borrowed or technical. Line names should end in a vowel.
- **Feminine form preferred:** Facilella is feminine (-ella ending). Line names in feminine form flow better in Italian copy: "la Facilella Sicura" vs "il Facilella Sicuro". Default to feminine form where the word has a gender choice.
- **Double-consonant caution:** Italian doubles (ll, tt, ss) are phonetically distinctive; they must be pronounced correctly. In compound position after Facilella's `-la`, avoid starting with `l-` (creates "Facilella L..." which sounds like one blurred word in casual speech).
- **False cognates:** Some Italian words look like English words but have different meanings or register. Score W and P carefully for any word where English-language Etsy buyers might misread.

---

## 10. Scope note

This spec generates Line Names for the `Facilella [Line Name]` compound. It does not:
- Generate standalone brand names (that is ASSESSMENT-04/05 territory)
- Generate product descriptions, taglines, or campaign copy
- Replace or supersede the ASSESSMENT-13 artifact — that document remains valid; this pipeline supplements it with systematic candidate generation

The output of this spec feeds directly into:
- `product-naming-candidates-2026-02-26.md` — agent-generated candidate table
- `product-naming-tm-2026-02-26.txt` — TM direction output from `tm-prescreen-cli.ts`
- `product-naming-shortlist-2026-02-26.user.md` — operator-facing shortlist
