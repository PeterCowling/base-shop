# MARKET-03 Deep Research Prompt — Caryina (HBAG) Pricing Benchmarks

## Context for the research agent

**Business:** Caryina — premium artisan bag accessories brand, Positano, Italy.
**Products under pricing test:**
- **H1 — Bag charm:** Birkin-style mini handbag worn on handbag strap. Target price hypothesis €95–€120.
- **H2 — AirPod holder:** Same body; sized for AirPods Pro / AirPods 4 with clip. Target price hypothesis €80–€100.

**Primary channel:** Etsy. Secondary discovery: Instagram / TikTok organic. Tourist channel: in-destination Positano boutique + Brikette hostel, June–September only.

**What MARKET-01 and MARKET-02 established — do NOT re-derive these:**

From MARKET-01 (competitor mapping):
- Premium artisan competitors price at $72–$104 USD: SexylittleVintage ($69–79, 3.7k reviews), SPECSET ($104, 839 reviews), TRIMleather ($69.90, 2.5k reviews), TyransLeatherShop ($72–89, 33 reviews), YLSecretHeart ($76–77, 655 reviews), NitmoiStudio ($55+, 71 reviews).
- PEGAI ($99, 107k sales) — biggest AirPod holder threat but US-only shipping.
- DTC players: Sticky Zoo (€61–85+), String Ting (£65–250), MAISON de SABRÉ (AUD $75 discounted).
- Mini handbag-shaped charms on Etsy cluster <$30; premium space dominated by bag jewellery and leather tech cases — not handbag-silhouette charms.

From MARKET-02 (demand evidence):
- Bag charm trend maturing toward craft/texture-led execution; buyers distinguish "reads premium" from cheap Etsy options.
- AirPods case category commoditised on Etsy (3,000+ items, many below $50); €80–€100 H2 needs "fashion accessory" framing, not "tech cover" framing.
- Buyer willingness to pay above MSRP for desired premium charm SKUs confirmed (Reddit collector thread).
- Price architecture on file: Etsy mid-market €15–60 / artisan premium €60–150 / accessible luxury €200–450 / ultra-luxury €450+.
- Coach bag charm $95 as accessible-luxury floor anchor; Miu Miu €200+ as ceiling; Hermès $930 / Chanel $950 as ultra-luxury H2 ceiling.

**What MARKET-03 must establish (research gaps):**
- Within the €60–€150 artisan premium band, where exactly do Etsy buyers convert? Is there a revealed preference cluster (e.g., most bag charm orders close between $72–$89, with sharp drop-off above $95)?
- Do premium-artisan Etsy listings at €80+ use any specific pricing psychology patterns (e.g., charm-plus-personalisation upsell, "made to order" premium, bundle pricing)?
- Is there a functional price ceiling on Etsy for non-luxury-branded leather accessories before buyers shift to DTC brand sites or accessible-luxury brands? What signals that ceiling?
- For H2 specifically: what does a $79–$99 AirPod case actually offer that the <$50 commodity cases do not — and do buyers articulate this in reviews? (Quality vocabulary: hardware, stitching, leather grain, case structure?)
- How do Caryina's target price points compare to observable conversion rates or listing performance in the Etsy premium tier? Any signals that $95–$120 is viable vs. "too high for Etsy"?
- For the Amalfi tourist channel: what price range do premium artisan accessories (leather sandals, ceramics, small leather goods) sell for in Positano retail? Is €100–€150 in normal range for this context?
- Any promotional or discounting norms in the category that would affect perceived value? (e.g., "sale" badges on Etsy, seasonal discount windows, bundle offers)

## Research Objectives

Produce pricing benchmark intelligence that validates or adjusts Caryina's €80–€150 price hypothesis. The goal is not to confirm that competitors charge these prices in the abstract — it is to understand whether Etsy buyers in the artisan-premium tier actually convert at €80–€150 and what price signals drive that conversion. Look for revealed pricing behaviour (what buyers pay, not just what sellers ask), review vocabulary (what justifies premium in buyer language), and any ceiling signals.

## Required Output Sections

### Section 1 — Benchmark Price Bands Across Direct Competitors

Build a price band table covering:
- The 10 MARKET-01 competitors and any additional artisan bag accessory Etsy sellers surfaced in research
- For each: exact listed price (note currency and date observed), product type (H1 bag charm / H2 tech case / bag jewellery / other), channel (Etsy / DTC), estimated review count (proxy for conversion volume), and any visible bundle or add-on options

Identify where the density of reviews and "bestseller" signals concentrates in the price spectrum. Is there a performance cliff above a certain price point?

**For H1 specifically:** Are there any handbag-silhouette charms (not just generic leather or jewellery charms) selling above $80 with verified engagement on Etsy? If yes, document. If none found, note this gap explicitly — it is a critical data point.

**For H2 specifically:** What is the highest-priced AirPods-specific leather case on Etsy with ≥50 reviews? What does it offer that justifies its premium vs. the $30–50 commodity tier?

### Section 2 — Pricing Model Patterns

Document observable pricing structures in the Etsy artisan premium tier:

- **One-off vs. made-to-order:** Do premium listings offer personalisation or custom engraving as an add-on? What uplift does this generate (list price vs. base price)?
- **Bundle pricing:** Are any sellers offering bag charm + AirPod holder sets? At what total price?
- **Material variation pricing:** Do sellers offer a "standard leather" vs. "premium leather" or "exotic" tier? What is the price gap?
- **Listing framing:** Do top-performing premium listings use framing that signals "investment piece" rather than "accessory purchase"? Examples of listing copy patterns.

### Section 3 — Discounting and Promotional Norms

- What is the frequency of "Sale" badge / discount display among premium artisan Etsy sellers in this category?
- Do any MARKET-01 competitors run seasonal promotions (Black Friday, Valentine's Day, end-of-season)?
- What is the Etsy fee structure's effect on sticker price (Etsy listing fee, transaction fee, offsite ads)? How much headroom does a €95 list price allow after platform costs, production, and shipping?
- Any observable "free shipping threshold" patterns? (A common Etsy price architecture decision: include shipping in item price vs. show separately.)

### Section 4 — Price-Quality Signalling Patterns

For artisan-premium listings that convert above $79:

- What photography and visual patterns are consistent? (Lifestyle shots vs. product-only, scale reference objects, material close-ups)
- What listing copy vocabulary signals quality and justifies premium? (e.g., "full grain leather", "solid brass hardware", "hand-stitched", "Italian leather", "made in [country]")
- What listing elements appear to be table-stakes for converting above $79 (i.e., missing them likely reduces conversion, even with good photography)?
- Is "origin story" (Italian-made, workshop provenance, artisan biography) present and prominent in listings that convert at premium prices? Any evidence this matters to buyers in reviews?

### Section 5 — Recommended Benchmark Range with Confidence Notes

Synthesise the above into a pricing recommendation framework for Caryina:

- **H1 validated range:** What price range is defensible for the Birkin-style bag charm on Etsy, given competitor conversion evidence?
- **H2 validated range:** What price range is defensible for the AirPod holder on Etsy?
- **Amalfi tourist channel range:** What premium is achievable in a physical retail context vs. Etsy, given Positano retail norms?
- **Optimal launch price hypothesis:** Based on observed price-performance patterns, what is the single recommended launch price for H1 and H2 that maximises both conversion probability and margin?
- **Key pricing risks:** What assumptions in the current €80–€150 hypothesis are most at risk of being wrong?

For each recommendation, tag: High / Medium / Low confidence, with source rationale.

## Scope Constraints

- **Primary lens: Etsy pricing and conversion signals.** Observable pricing behaviour is the priority — seller listing prices, review volumes, bestseller signals.
- **Secondary lens: fashion editorial gift guides and DTC brand pricing** — these set the aspirational ceiling but are not the direct conversion environment.
- **Do NOT** produce a general margin analysis or cost model. Focus on observable market pricing, not unit economics. (Unit economics and margin modelling are in LOGISTICS-04.)
- **Geography:** EU + North America primary (consistent with Etsy shopper base); Italy secondary for tourist ICP.
- **Time horizon:** Current (Q1 2026) pricing. Note any recently changed prices where visible.

## Prior research on file (do not repeat — extend or challenge)

Already documented and confirmed:
- Price architecture tiers: Etsy mid-market €15–60 / artisan premium €60–150 / accessible luxury €200–450 / ultra-luxury €450+
- Coach bag charm $95 (accessible-luxury floor anchor)
- Miu Miu €200+ (ceiling for artisan tier)
- Hermès $930 / Chanel $950 (ultra-luxury H2 ceiling)
- PEGAI $99 AirPods case (107k sales, US-only shipping)
- KILLSPENCER $55 AirPod holder (artisan mid-market H2 anchor)
- Competitor set: see MARKET-01 full table

Your job is to **add precision within the artisan-premium band** — not restate tier boundaries already on record. The critical gap is conversion evidence at €80–€120 specifically, not just the existence of listings at that price.
