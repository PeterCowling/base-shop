# EU CE Marking and Product Safety: Children's Mini Faux-Leather Handbag (Ages 6–10)

**Investigation date:** 2026-02-18
**Scope:** Regulatory compliance path for a small faux-leather/leather handbag marketed to children aged 6–10 for EU sale.
**Status:** Research complete — recommendation in Section 5.

## 1. Does CE Marking Apply? Which Directive(s)?

**Short answer: CE marking does NOT automatically apply to a children's handbag. The determining question is whether the product is classified as a toy.**

CE marking in the EU is required only when a product falls within the scope of a specific CE-marking directive or regulation. There is no blanket CE-marking requirement for children's fashion accessories. The two potential CE-marking frameworks are:

### 1a. Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC (and its successor Regulation (EU) 2025/2509)

The Toy Safety Directive (TSD) applies to "products designed or intended, whether or not exclusively, for use in play by children under 14 years of age" (Article 2(1), Directive 2009/48/EC).

**Annex I of the TSD explicitly lists products that are NOT toys.** Relevant exclusion: **"Fashion accessories for children which are not for use in play."** A handbag marketed purely as a child's fashion accessory — not designed or intended to be a plaything — falls within this Annex I exclusion and is outside TSD scope.

The line is fact-dependent. Market surveillance authorities assess:
- The product's physical characteristics (does it look like a toy handbag with a doll motif?)
- Marketing materials (is it presented in a play context?)
- Whether a reasonable parent/supervisor would assume it is for play (the "reasonable assumption" test in Article 2(1))

A mini handbag marketed for a 6–10 year old girl as a fashion accessory (for use at school, parties, etc.) with no play features **should qualify for the Annex I fashion-accessories exclusion.** If the product has toy-like features (incorporated doll, rattle, squeaker, etc.), TSD applies and CE marking is mandatory.

**Note on Regulation (EU) 2025/2509:** This new Toy Safety Regulation was published December 2025 and will eventually repeal Directive 2009/48/EC. The fashion-accessories exclusion carries over in substance. For 2026, Directive 2009/48/EC remains the operative instrument.

### 1b. Summary of CE-Marking Position

| Scenario | CE marking required? | Applicable instrument |
|---|---|---|
| Handbag with no play features, marketed as fashion accessory | **No** | GPSR applies; no CE mark |
| Handbag with toy-like features (dolls, play elements) | Yes | TSD 2009/48/EC |
| Handbag explicitly marketed as a "toy handbag" | Yes | TSD 2009/48/EC |

---

## 2. Which Clauses of the Toy Safety Directive Are Relevant — If Any?

**TSD 2009/48/EC likely does NOT apply to a straightforward children's fashion handbag.** The Annex I, item 10 exclusion ("fashion accessories for children which are not for use in play") is the key safe harbour.

### If TSD Applied (Contingency Only)

If the product were reclassified as a toy:
- **Article 10 (Essential safety requirements):** Annex II compliance (physical/mechanical, flammability, chemical, electrical, hygiene).
- **Annex II, Part III (Chemical properties):** EN 71-3 limits for heavy metals, CMR substances, allergenic fragrances. Relevant for dyed faux-leather.
- **Article 17 (Conformity assessment):** Internal production control (Module A) or third-party EC type-examination (Module B+C) where no harmonised standards exist.
- **Article 19 (CE marking):** CE mark affixed before placing on market.
- **Article 21 (Declaration of conformity):** EU DoC required.
- **Annex IV (Technical documentation):** Technical file retained 10 years.

**Conclusion:** If the handbag is designed as a fashion accessory with no play function, TSD clauses are not directly applicable. Rely on Annex I exclusion, but document this determination in the GPSR technical file.

## 3. Testing and Certification Required — and Approximate Cost

### Path A: Non-toy (fashion accessory) — GPSR + REACH only

This is the expected path.

#### General Product Safety Regulation (EU) 2023/988 — in force 13 December 2024

GPSR replaced GPSD 2001/95/EC. Key obligations:

- **Article 9(1):** Manufacturers must carry out an internal risk analysis before placing on the market.
- **Article 9(2):** Technical documentation retained for **10 years** after last sale: product description, safety characteristics, risk analysis, standards applied, traceability information.
- **Article 9(3):** Product must bear name, registered trade name/trademark, and postal/email contact.
- **Article 9(5):** Instructions and safety information in the language of each target Member State.
- **Article 9(7):** Special attention to vulnerable groups (children) in the risk analysis.
- **Article 10:** EU Authorised Representative required if manufacturer is outside EU — new hard requirement under GPSR 2023/988.

GPSR does **not** require CE marking, third-party testing, or notified body involvement — it is a self-assessed general safety obligation.

#### REACH Regulation (EC) 1907/2006 — Annex XVII Restricted Substances

| Restriction | Entry | Limit | Applicability |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phthalates (DEHP, DBP, BBP, DIBP) | Entry 51 (amended by Reg. (EU) 2018/2005) | 0.1% by weight of plasticised material | Faux leather (PVC, PU) — ALL articles, not just toys |
| Azo dyes (carcinogenic aromatic amines) | Entry 43 | 30 mg/kg | Leather and textile colouring |
| Chromium VI in leather | Entry 47 | 0.0003% by weight dry leather | Real leather; typically N/A for faux leather |
| SVHC (Candidate List) | Article 33 + SCIP | >0.1% in article: disclosure + SCIP notification | All articles |

**Critical note:** Phthalate restrictions (Entry 51) apply to ALL articles since the 2018 amendment — not just toys. This is the primary chemical compliance risk for PVC faux leather.

#### Approximate REACH Testing Costs (per material substrate)

| Test | Cost per substrate |
|---|---|
| Phthalate screen (EN 15777 / IEC 62321-8) | EUR 60–150 |
| Azo dye panel (EN ISO 14362-1) | EUR 80–180 |
| Chromium VI / heavy metals (leather only) | EUR 60–120 |
| Full REACH RSL panel (multi-analyte) | EUR 300–600 |

For a handbag with 2–3 material substrates: **EUR 500–1,500 total** from an accredited EU lab (SGS, Intertek, Eurofins, Bureau Veritas). Asian labs (IEC 17025-accredited) typically 30–50% lower.

### Path B: Toy Classification (Contingency)

| Test | Indicative cost |
|---|---|
| EN 71-1 (Mechanical and physical) | USD 200–400 |
| EN 71-2 (Flammability) | USD 150–250 |
| EN 71-3 (Migration of elements) | USD 200–500 |
| EU DoC + technical file consultancy | EUR 500–2,000 |
| **Total** | **USD 1,000–3,000+** |

## 4. Simpler Compliance Path

**Yes — GPSR + REACH + age labelling is the legitimate and expected route for a non-toy children's fashion accessory.**

### Recommended Compliance Stack

1. **Positively document the product as a non-toy fashion accessory.** Include in the GPSR technical file: written scope determination citing TSD Annex I (fashion accessories exclusion) and confirming the product is not designed or intended for play. Avoid toy-like marketing imagery.

2. **GPSR technical documentation (Article 9(2)):** Product description, photographs, risk analysis (age-appropriate risk scenarios: drawstring, small parts, chemical exposure), REACH test reports, labelling copies. Retain 10 years.

3. **REACH Annex XVII compliance:** Commission REACH RSL testing on all material substrates (faux leather, lining, metal hardware). Obtain written supplier declarations for SVHC substances. Submit SCIP notification if any SVHC >0.1%.

4. **Age and safety labelling (GPSR Article 9(5)):** Manufacturer name, address, product identifier. Safety information in language of each target Member State. Age recommendation ("Recommended for ages 6+") in technical file and packaging where relevant — note this is a risk-communication measure, not a route to avoid TSD classification.

5. **EU Authorised Representative (GPSR Article 10):** If manufacturer is outside the EU (e.g. China), appoint an EU-based AR with a written mandate before market placement. This is mandatory under GPSR 2023/988.

### What Age Labelling Does NOT Do

An age label ("Not for children under 3" or "Recommended for ages 6+") does **not** by itself exclude a product from TSD scope. Market surveillance authorities assess the product's actual design and marketed function, not the label alone.

---

## 5. Practical Recommendation

**Recommendation: Proceed with H5 (children's variant) under the GPSR + REACH non-toy compliance path.**

### Rationale

A mini faux-leather handbag for ages 6–10, positioned as a children's fashion accessory (not a toy), has a well-established regulatory pathway:
- No CE marking required
- No notified body or EN 71 toy testing required
- Total compliance cost: **EUR 1,000–3,000** (REACH testing + GPSR documentation + EU AR if non-EU manufacturer)

### Required Guardrails to Maintain Non-Toy Classification

| Guardrail | Rationale |
|---|---|
| No play-function design features (no squeakers, incorporated dolls, noise/light elements) | Prevents "intended for play" characterisation under TSD Article 2(1) |
| Marketing copy must not reference play scenarios | Avoids reasonable-assumption test being triggered |
| Product photography: fashion/lifestyle context only, not play context | Consistency with technical file classification |
| Written scope determination documented in technical file | Evidence for market surveillance authority review |
| Full REACH RSL testing commissioned on all substrates before launch | Mandatory — REACH Annex XVII applies to all articles |
| EU Authorised Representative appointed if manufacturer is non-EU | Mandatory under GPSR 2023/988 Article 10 |
| SCIP database notification submitted if any SVHC >0.1% | REACH Article 33 + SCIP obligation |

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Level | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| TSD reclassification (toy-like aesthetics) | Medium, manageable | Ensure fashion-led design; document in technical file |
| REACH phthalates in PVC faux leather | Low-medium | Commission testing early; request supplier REACH declarations |
| GPSR EU Authorised Representative (new 2024 requirement) | Low | Identify and appoint EU AR before launch |
| Regulation (EU) 2025/2509 transition | Low, near-term | Monitor application date; fashion-accessories exclusion retained |

### Abandon Threshold

Abandon H5 only if:
- Product design cannot be modified to remove toy-like features and TSD clearly applies, **OR**
- REACH testing reveals unresolvable chemical compliance failures in the supply chain.

Neither scenario is expected for a straightforward faux-leather bag design.
