**P09 missing artifacts:**
- `docs/business-os/startup-baselines/BRIK/demand-evidence-pack.md` (not at canonical gate-check path; market intelligence exists at non-canonical `market-research/BRIK/` path)
- `docs/plans/brik-ga4-baseline-lock/plan.md` (referenced in weekly KPCS Section C as P1 routing, but plan file does not exist)
- `docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/*offer*.user.md` (S2B — intentionally deferred per prioritization scorecard)
- `docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/messaging-hierarchy.user.md` (S2B — index.user.md Status: —; intentionally deferred)
- `docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/*channel*.user.md` (S6B — explicitly deferred per prioritization scorecard)

**Evidence notes:**
- P01: weekly-kpcs-decision.user.md (Sections A→B shows gather-then-decide structure) and forecast v1 (observed vs assumed labels visible). Pattern mostly clear. Support=3.
- P02: forecast v1 uses P10/P50/P90 scenarios and "observed vs assumption" labels — good awareness. But no explicit per-dimension confidence scores with "what would raise this" actions. Support=3.
- P03: Reviewed plan.user.md, forecast v1, prioritization-scorecard. No `/review-critique` call referenced. Risk section in plan.user.md is specific (not generic), and risks have mitigations. But no adversarial review artifact. Support=4 (absence clearly confirmed).
- P04: Measurement-verification shows real curl/GA4 commands and real values. Historical booking anchors (EUR 212,882.66 / 786 bookings 2025 season) are real observed data. But begin_checkout=0 and web_vitals=0 in 7-day window means key conversion-funnel assumptions (CVR 1.9% P50) have no real anchor yet. Support=4.
- P05: startup-loop/SKILL.md — "ORCHESTRATE + GATE + HANDOFF" operating mode; dispatch table routes to lp-* executor skills; no stage-specific execution logic embedded. Support=5.
- P06: weekly-kpcs Section D shows named owner + pass criteria per action. Actual plan task files not deep-checked. Support=3.
- P07: cmd-advance.md S10 dispatch uses scoped `--biz` and `--run-root` params. Forecast references inputs by path. Support=3.
- P08: One weekly KPCS exists (2026-02-13). We are now 2026-02-18 — 5 days later with no new readout. The action plan from week 1 (begin_checkout verification, GA4 baseline refresh, policy/fee clarity, cancellation coding) has no documented outcome check. Support=4 (absence confirmed by directory scan).
- P09: All canonical paths checked. 5 files missing/absent. Two are intentionally deferred (S2B, S6B stages not started). Two are structural gaps: demand-evidence-pack.md not at canonical path; brik-ga4-baseline-lock plan referenced but doesn't exist. Support=5.
- P10: prioritization-scorecard.user.md (Owner: Pete, no Human-approved field) and weekly-kpcs-decision.user.md (Decision: Continue by Pete, no ## Human Decisions section). S2B/S6B artifacts missing so P10 defers to P09 for those stages. Owner field is present and Pete is clearly the decision-maker — this is a convention gap, not a run-validity threat. Per P10 special handling: Severity=3/Support=3 (below finding threshold).

## Top Findings

### Finding 1: Checkpointed Restartability — demand-evidence-pack.md absent from canonical path; brik-ga4-baseline-lock plan referenced but does not exist

- Fingerprint: `P09-S2-missing-demand-evidence-pack`
- Severity: 4
- Support: 5
- Stage(s) affected: S2 (demand evidence / market intelligence), general (plan restartability)
- Failure indicator: The canonical path `docs/business-os/startup-baselines/BRIK/demand-evidence-pack.md` checked by GATE-S6B-STRAT-01 does not exist; the weekly KPCS references `docs/plans/brik-ga4-baseline-lock/plan.md` as an active P1 routing artifact but that plan file also does not exist
- Evidence pointer: `docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/2026-02-13-weekly-kpcs-decision.user.md` Section C — `docs/plans/brik-ga4-baseline-lock/fact-find.md` and `plan.md` cited; directory scan confirms neither exists
- Status: Novel

**Why this matters**: Two checkpointing gaps: (1) Market intelligence for BRIK exists at `docs/business-os/market-research/BRIK/2026-02-12-market-intelligence.user.md` but GATE-S6B-STRAT-01 checks a different canonical path — meaning the gate will block S6B even though the underlying research has been done. If the run is restarted or S6B is attempted, the gate will fail with a misleading error. (2) The GA4 baseline lock plan is cited as a P1 work item in the weekly readout but the plan file doesn't exist — meaning there is no way to track task completion or restart from checkpoint for this P1 work stream.

```

Fingerprint: `P09-S2-missing-demand-evidence-pack`

**Summary** (3 bullets — fill before promoting):
- What: Two canonical artifact paths referenced in the BRIK run do not resolve: (1) the demand-evidence-pack.md at the path checked by GATE-S6B-STRAT-01, (2) the brik-ga4-baseline-lock plan cited in the weekly readout as active P1 work
- Why: Gate failures at S6B will mislead the operator (research exists but at wrong path); the GA4 baseline lock work has no plan checkpoint, making its completion state unverifiable
- Next: Either create `docs/business-os/startup-baselines/BRIK/demand-evidence-pack.md` linking to the existing market intelligence artifact, or update the gate check path; separately, create `docs/plans/brik-ga4-baseline-lock/plan.md` or remove the reference from the weekly KPCS

### Finding 2: Ground Truth Anchoring — conversion-funnel assumptions unanchored; key CVR targets have no measured basis

- Fingerprint: `P04-S2A-conversion-signal-zero-no-real-cvr-anchor`
- Severity: 4
- Support: 4
- Stage(s) affected: S2A (measurement verification), S3 (forecast)
- Failure indicator: The 90-day forecast CVR assumptions (1.6%/1.9%/2.1% P10/P50/P90) have no traceable real-world conversion event data — begin_checkout and web_vitals were both 0 in the locked 7-day baseline window; the only real anchors are historical booking volume, not conversion rate
- Evidence pointer: `docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/2026-02-13-startup-loop-90-day-forecast-v1.user.md` Unit Economics table ("Blended CVR: assumption (to be measured)"); `docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/plan.user.md` Metrics section (`begin_checkout: 0`, `Conversions: 0`)
- Status: Novel

**Why this matters**: The S3 forecast explicitly notes "not fully decision-grade until event-level GA4 checks and 7-14 day measured funnel baselines are captured." That same qualification is still true as of today (2026-02-18). All guardrails in the run contract (CVR <1.2% → hold spend; CAC >EUR 130 → retargeting-only) depend on a measured CVR baseline. Without non-zero conversion-intent signal, the P50 scenario's core metric (1.9% CVR) is a historical analogy, not a measured fact for this funnel. Engineering work in brikette-cta-sales-funnel-ga4 is addressing the booking flow, but the upstream measurement closure has not been confirmed in a locked 7-day window yet.

---
```

Fingerprint: `P04-S2A-conversion-signal-zero-no-real-cvr-anchor`

**Summary** (3 bullets — fill before promoting):
- What: The forecast CVR assumptions (1.6–2.1%) have no measured anchor in the BRIK funnel; begin_checkout=0 in the first locked 7-day GA4 window means all guardrails depending on CVR are operating blind
- Why: Guardrail thresholds in the run contract (CVR <1.2% → hold spend; CAC >EUR 130 → retargeting only) cannot be evaluated without a non-zero conversion baseline; the day-14 gate review specified in S3 requires measured CVR to be actionable
- Next: Verify that begin_checkout events are now non-zero in a refreshed 7-day window (post brikette-cta-sales-funnel-ga4 shipping); lock the refreshed baseline with an explicit timestamp; update the S3 forecast qualification note with the confirmation date

### Finding 3: Feedback Loop Closure — no second weekly readout; week-1 action items have no outcome check

- Fingerprint: `P08-S10-no-second-weekly-readout`
- Severity: 4
- Support: 4
- Stage(s) affected: S10 (weekly readout)
- Failure indicator: The only KPCS readout is dated 2026-02-13; as of 2026-02-18 (5 days later) no second readout has been produced; the five action items from week 1 have no documented outcome verification
- Evidence pointer: `docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/` directory listing — only one `*kpcs*.user.md` artifact present (`2026-02-13-weekly-kpcs-decision.user.md`)
- Status: Novel

**Why this matters**: The week-1 KPCS explicitly set five follow-up actions with named pass criteria: begin_checkout verification, refreshed GA4 baseline, policy/fee clarity shipping, cancellation reason coding, day-14 gate review. Without a week-2 readout, there is no record of which actions completed, which stalled, and whether the measured baselines changed. The day-14 gate review (due ~2026-02-27) depends on a weekly measurement cadence being established first. Each missed readout is a blind week that cannot be reconstructed.

Business-Unit: BRIK
Card-ID: none
---
```

Fingerprint: `P08-S10-no-second-weekly-readout`

**Summary** (3 bullets — fill before promoting):
- What: No second weekly KPCS readout has been produced for BRIK; the feedback loop has not completed a second cycle despite 5 days elapsing since week 1
- Why: Week-1 action items (begin_checkout fix, GA4 baseline refresh, policy/fee clarity, cancellation coding, day-14 gate prep) have no outcome record; the day-14 gate review window is approaching without a measurement update
- Next: Produce the week-2 KPCS now using the weekly-kpcs-decision-prompt.md template; verify which week-1 actions completed; refresh the 7-day GA4 extract and lock a new baseline timestamp

## How to Promote a Finding Brief

To act on a finding:

1. Copy the **Promotion stub** from the Finding Brief you want to promote.
2. Create a new file at `docs/plans/<finding-slug>/fact-find.md`.
3. Paste the frontmatter stub. Fill remaining required fields from `docs/plans/_templates/fact-find-planning.md`.
4. Add `Fingerprint: <fingerprint>` in the body (not in frontmatter).
5. Run `/lp-fact-find` on the brief to complete the evidence audit and gap review.
6. Once promoted, future Signal Reviews will suppress this fingerprint (dedup source: open plan tasks).
