  "intro": [
    "Laurito is a pocket-sized cove tucked between Positano and Praiano. Two beach clubs — Da Adolfo and Villa Tre Ville — dominate the shoreline, leaving just a sliver of public sand. The reward is west-facing sunshine, iconic lunch spots, and a quieter atmosphere than Spiaggia Grande.",
    "For hostel guests, Laurito is the “treat yourself” beach day: you can swim in a calm bay, linger over a long lunch, and still be back in town for sunset drinks — as long as you plan the return.",
    "Use this guide to choose between Da Adolfo and Villa Tre Ville, understand how the shuttle boats work, and build a reliable backup plan with %LINK:lauritoBeachBusDown|the bus route% and %LINK:lauritoBeachBusBack|the return guide%."

        "If you want the easy version: pick one “primary route” and one “backup route” before you leave the hostel. Laurito is small, and the day is great when you arrive relaxed — not when you are improvising at the pier with no signal.",
        "Staff tip: in peak months, the two things that derail plans are (1) full boats and (2) rough sea that pauses shuttles. If you plan for those two, the rest is easy."

        "Choose your vibe: Da Adolfo for a classic lunch-and-lounger day, or Villa Tre Ville for a premium deck and quieter service. If you just want the cove, aim for the tiny public strip early and bring your own shade.",
        "Primary route (most convenient): shuttle boat from Spiaggia Grande. Confirm where to queue and ask about the last return when you arrive.",
        "Backup route (most reliable): %LINK:lauritoBeachBusDown|bus down to Laurito% + stairs; then %LINK:lauritoBeachBusBack|bus back up% later in the day.",
        "Set your “go/no-go” time: if you do not have a booking, leaving earlier increases your odds. If it is already late morning and you see boat queues, consider an alternative like %LINK:positanoBeaches|another Positano beach% instead of forcing Laurito.",

      "body": [
        "Laurito sits just outside Positano's centre, so crowds thin out compared with Spiaggia Grande. Sun hits the cove until early evening, the water is usually calm for swimming, and the cliffs frame the bay for classic Amalfi Coast photos.",
        "It is also one of the easiest places to turn a beach day into a memorable “long lunch” day. Both clubs run proper kitchens (not just snacks), so you can swim, eat, and lounge without trekking back into town.",
        "The tradeoff is access: most of the shoreline is controlled by the clubs, and the public strip is genuinely small. If you show up without a plan, Laurito can feel like a dead end. If you show up with a booking or a clear backup route, it is one of the most relaxed half-day trips from Hostel Brikette.",
        "If Laurito looks too tight on the day (queues, full boats, or you want more free space), compare it with alternatives in our %LINK:positanoBeaches|Positano beaches overview%."

        "Boat route (best when you have a booking): head to Spiaggia Grande and find the small pier/boarding point used by the beach shuttles. Lines can build quickly, especially on calm, sunny days. If you are unsure, ask at the dock and show the club name you are aiming for so you board the right boat.",
        "Bus route (best backup): follow %LINK:lauritoBeachBusDown|our step-by-step bus guide% to reach the Laurito stop and then walk down the signposted stairs. This is slower than the boat, but it is also the plan that still works when the water taxis pause.",
        "Return plan: even if you arrive by boat, keep %LINK:lauritoBeachBusBack|the return-by-bus guide% saved on your phone. It is the simplest “plan B” if you miss the last shuttle or the sea picks up.",

        "What makes it worth it: less chaos, better spacing between loungers, and a calmer vibe if you want to read, nap, or work through a hangover in peace. If you are travelling as a couple or a small group and want a predictable day, this is usually the smoother choice.",

        "If you are returning after a long lunch, build in buffer time. Buses can run crowded and slow, and it is easier to catch an earlier bus than to salvage a missed last one. If you end up out after dark, taxis are possible but expensive — ask the hostel for the best option that day."
