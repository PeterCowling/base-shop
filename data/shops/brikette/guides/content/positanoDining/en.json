    "Positano restaurants range from €7 takeaway pizzas to €100+ tasting menus. This guide focuses on dining spots within walking distance or a quick SITA bus hop from Hostel Brikette in Chiesa Nuova, with clear costs, booking needs, and how to get there.",
    "Most nearby spots are flat or downhill on Via Marconi, but seaside restaurants require steep stairs on the return. Budget €35–€60 for sit-down dinners, or €7–€12 for casual takeaway. Reserve terrace tables at least a day ahead in summer.",
    "For signature experiences, La Tagliata's farmhouse feast runs €65 with transport included, and La Gavitella's sunset boat dinner costs about €139. Both need advance booking and fill up fast in July-August."

        "**La Gavitella's sunset cruise** combines a boat ride from Positano's main beach (Spiaggia Grande) with a seafood tasting menu at their Praiano terrace. The full package costs about €139 per person and includes the return boat crossing. Board 15 minutes early at the beach—staff will check you in before departure. The ride takes roughly 20 minutes each way, and you'll eat as the sun sets over the coast.",
        "**La Tagliata** sits 3 km uphill in the village of Montepertuso. You can ride the SITA bus toward Nocelle and hop off just after the village sign, then walk five minutes along a signed lane. Or ask the restaurant to send their complimentary shuttle—tell them your pickup time at Hostel Brikette when you book. The meal is a generous farmhouse feast for €65: antipasti, handmade pasta, grilled meats, salad, dessert, and flowing house wine. Expect 2+ hours of courses served family-style on long tables with sweeping views.",
        "Both restaurants get fully booked in peak season (July-August), so reserve at least 2-3 days ahead. Mention you're staying at Hostel Brikette so shuttles know exactly where to collect you. Pack a light layer for the boat return or evening breeze in Montepertuso."

        "Chiesa Nuova (where Hostel Brikette sits) offers several dining options within 5 minutes on foot, most of them flat or gently downhill on Via Marconi.",
        "**C'era Una Volta** is almost opposite the hostel entrance. It's the go-to for takeaway pizzas (€7–€12) or sit-down meals with classic Neapolitan-style crusts and fresh toppings. No reservation needed for takeaway; arrive before 8pm to avoid queues.",
        "**Il Grottino Azzurro** is 160 m away on the same street (2 minutes flat). They serve Campanian classics—think paccheri al ragu, fresh fish, lemon desserts—for around €35 per person. The terrace catches afternoon sun, and you can usually walk in at lunch. Dinner books up in summer, so call ahead or ask the hostel concierge.",
        "**Da Gabrisa** (260 m away, 52 m downhill) and **Next2** (270 m away, 75 m downhill) both offer terrace views and multi-course tasting menus around €60. These are good splurge options when you want something special without hiking far. Both take reservations via phone or the hostel's concierge service—book a day ahead for terrace seating.",
        "**Da Costantino** rewards a short 300 m uphill stroll (about 5 minutes) with window views and hearty portions from roughly €30. It's a family-run spot with generous pasta plates and grilled meats. Walk-ins usually work at lunch; dinner is busier.",
        "**Luna at Villa Magia** is a 7-minute downhill walk (450 m, 90 m elevation loss) for a special-occasion tasting menu around €100. The setting is elegant with terraced gardens, and the kitchen focuses on modern takes on Amalfi ingredients. Expect a 2+ hour meal. Book well in advance, and remember the uphill return—wear comfortable shoes or arrange a %LINK:porterServices|porter% to carry you back if needed."

        "**Buca di Bacco** anchors Positano's main beach (1 km from the hostel, 167 m downhill). It's a polished beachfront restaurant with tablecloths, attentive service, and seafood-focused menus around €50 per person. The walk down takes 15-20 minutes via stairs and pedestrian lanes. The return is steep—budget 25-30 minutes uphill, or book a %LINK:porterServices|porter% if you've had wine. Reservations essential in summer.",
        "**Il Ritrovo** in Montepertuso and **La Taverna del Leone** near Laurito both require a SITA bus ride (2.3 km and 4 km from the hostel respectively). Both serve €45–€55 tasting menus with sweeping coastal views. Catch the bus from Chiesa Nuova toward Nocelle (for Il Ritrovo) or toward Praiano (for La Taverna). Check the last bus back before you sit down—services thin out after 10pm in low season.",
        "You can also order standard menus at La Tagliata and La Gavitella without the premium packages. Expect to pay about €50 per person for sharing plates, produce from their own gardens, and panoramic terrace seating. Still excellent value, just without the boat transfer or shuttle included.",

        "**Booking ahead:** Reserve terrace tables at least 1-2 days ahead in high season (June-September). Walk-in spots dry up fast after 7pm. Use the Hostel Brikette concierge or call directly—mention you're at the hostel so shuttles and porters know the exact pickup point.",
        "**Transport:** SITA bus tickets cost €1.30–€2.50 depending on distance. Buy them at tobacco shops (tabacchi) or onboard with contactless payment. Buses run every 30-60 minutes; check the %LINK:sitaTickets|timetable% and allow a 20-minute buffer in peak season when they fill up.",
        "**Stairs and terrain:** Most restaurants near the hostel are flat or gently downhill. Seaside spots like Buca di Bacco involve steep stairs on the return—wear secure footwear and pace yourself. If you've overindulged, porter services cost €30–€50 for the uphill carry back to Chiesa Nuova.",
        "**Payment:** Most places accept cards, but smaller trattorie prefer cash. ATMs are available in Positano center (near the main beach). Tipping isn't mandatory but 5-10% is appreciated for excellent service.",
        "**Weather contingencies:** Rough seas occasionally cancel evening boat transfers to Praiano and Laurito. Keep the SITA bus timetable as a backup. In winter (November-March), some restaurants close or operate reduced hours—call ahead to confirm."
