## Problem Statement

Women who own aspirational handbags (LV/Gucci entry tier and above) are actively looking for
considered accessories that feel genuinely crafted — not mass-produced, not generic, not obviously
cheap in photos. At the €80–€150 price point, the buyer wants something that "reads real" both
in hand and on social media.

The market currently fails this buyer at both ends:

- **Below €80**: Etsy mid-market accessories look and feel cheap, damage perceived bag quality,
  and have no brand story — the buyer rejects them as unworthy of her handbag.
- **Above €200**: Accessible-luxury brand charms (Miu Miu, Loewe) are aspirationally priced;
  ultra-luxury (Hermes, Balenciaga) are out of reach for this use case.

The **artisan premium white space at €80–€150** is essentially unoccupied by a coherent brand with:
an Italian origin story, consistent craft-quality photography, and premium positioning.

**Falsifiable form:** If Etsy buyers are willing to pay €80–€150 for an artisan bag charm or AirPod
holder with Italian provenance and craft-quality photography, then ≥3 paid orders within 28 days of
listing launch is evidence the problem is real and priced correctly.

## Primary ICP

**Who:** Women ~27–42, fashion-aware, who own at least one aspirational handbag (LV/Gucci entry tier,
€600–€1,500+). They follow Instagram/TikTok accessory trends and have been noticing the bag charm
trend in their feeds. They deliberate 3–7 days before purchasing at €80–€150 — this is a considered
purchase, not an impulse buy.

**Their failure state:** Every accessory option at their price point either looks cheap, has no
story, or isn't worth risking on the strap of a bag they care about.

**Discovery path:** TikTok/Instagram scroll → trend exposure → Etsy search ("artisan bag charm",
"leather mini bag charm", "Birkin style bag charm") or direct DM inquiry.

**Mindset at decision moment:** "Is this quality worth €89?" — they want craft proof (macro shot,
stitching detail, hardware close-up) and an origin story (Italian maker) that justifies the price.

## Open Questions (from intake packet Section F)

| Question | Priority |
|----------|---------|
| Unit cost + MOQ from China supplier | Critical — blocks margin stack |
| Photography perception test (TASK-06): ≥3/5 cold reviewers estimate ≥€80 | Critical — gates listing |
| Instagram/TikTok account status for HBAG | High |
| Etsy shop status (exists or must create) | High |

## Pivot / Refresh Protocol

This file is the living problem framing for MARKET-01 and DO stages. Update here when:
- Pricing or positioning changes significantly
- A new ICP segment is confirmed with evidence
- Market context shifts materially (e.g., trend reversal, new entrant at artisan tier)
- After any demand evidence review (MARKET-08, MARKET-09)

Do NOT update this file for minor adjustments — only for framing-level changes.
