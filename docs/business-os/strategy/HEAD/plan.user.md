# Headband — Business Plan

## Strategy

### Current Focus (2026-02-12)

1. **Active Outcome Contract (Canonical)** (Priority: High)
   - Canonical contract (source of truth): `docs/business-os/contracts/HEAD/outcome-contract.user.md`
   - Outcome-ID: `HEAD-OUT-2026Q1-01`
   - Decision Link: `DEC-HEAD-01` (scale paid expansion vs hold and fix).
   - Owner: Pete

2. **Offer Definition** (Priority: High)
   - Status: Product proposition and differentiation are not yet finalized.
   - Next: Finalize offer statement and attach testable customer-value claims.
   - Artifact: `docs/business-os/strategy/HEAD/headband-90-day-launch-forecast-v2.user.md`
   - Exec Summary: `docs/business-os/strategy/HEAD/headband-90-day-launch-forecast-v2-exec-summary.user.md`

3. **Launch Signal Design** (Priority: Medium)
   - Status: Baseline is now defined, but most signals are still week-0 and need measured values.
   - Next: Run weekly scorecard and enforce kill/pivot thresholds without exception.
   - Dry-run Evidence: `docs/business-os/strategy/HEAD/2026-02-11-week2-gate-dry-run.user.md`
   - Action Backlog: `docs/business-os/strategy/HEAD/launch-readiness-action-backlog.user.md`

### 90-Day Outcome Contract (Reference)

All authoritative target, guardrail, and kill/pivot contract values are maintained only in:

- `docs/business-os/contracts/HEAD/outcome-contract.user.md`

This plan consumes that contract and does not redefine outcome target/CAC fields.

## Risks

### Active Risks

- **Unclear Differentiation** (Severity: High, Added: 2026-02-11)
  - Source: Offer framing and value proposition remain broad.
  - Impact: Weak demand signal and low conversion confidence.
  - Mitigation: Define a narrow ICP and value claim before expansion.

- **Measurement Gap** (Severity: Medium, Added: 2026-02-11)
  - Source: Baseline is locked but not yet populated with observed week-1/week-2 values.
  - Impact: Decisions can drift back to opinion.
  - Mitigation: Establish and enforce weekly scorecard before major expansion.

## Metrics

### Launch Readiness (Established: 2026-02-12)

- **Demand Signal:** Week-0 baseline
  - Target: see canonical outcome contract guardrail set
  - Measurement: Sessions by channel (weekly)

- **Conversion Signal:** Week-0 baseline
  - Target: see canonical outcome contract guardrail set
  - Measurement: Orders / sessions (weekly)

- **Economics Signal:** Week-0 baseline
  - Target: see canonical outcome contract guardrail set
  - Measurement: Paid spend / orders (weekly)

- **Reliability Signal:** Week-0 baseline
  - Target: see canonical outcome contract guardrail set
  - Measurement: Checkout + operations logs (weekly)
