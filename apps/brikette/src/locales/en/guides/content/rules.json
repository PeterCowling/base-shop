        "Because we are a licensed venue, you may not bring or consume alcohol bought off-site anywhere on hostel property. If you arrive with outside alcohol, our team will store it safely and return it at checkout (or once you confirm it will be consumed off-site). Our team's decision on this is final. Bringing or drinking outside alcohol will cancel your booking on the spot, be treated as a No-Show, and no refund will be issued."

Any illegal activity will be reported straight away to local authorities."
