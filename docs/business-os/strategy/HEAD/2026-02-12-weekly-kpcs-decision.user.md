# HEAD Weekly K/P/C/S Decision

## A) KPI Delta Summary

- This remains a pre-scale week with no material live-sales denominator yet.
- Baseline still effectively week-0/early week-1: orders and CAC evidence not decision-grade.

## B) Decision

Decision: **Continue**.

Rationale:
- Canonical S2B/S3/S6B artifacts are now backfilled and aligned to the outcome contract.
- Top-3 MVP lane is explicit and low-risk (multi-pack headbands, organiser pouch, patch packs).
- Immediate next step is execution and denominator-quality data capture, not channel or strategy pivot.

## C) What Changed This Week

Signal:
- Canonical startup-baseline artifacts now exist for offer, forecast, and channels.
- Naming shortlist has been returned and is pending clearance decision.
- Prioritization has shifted from generic launch tasks to concrete MVP productisation tasks.

Noise:
- No decision-grade live demand/economics data yet; no scale/kill call can be made.

## D) Next-Week Action Plan

1. Confirm stock date and sellable units for all top-3 MVP SKUs.
2. Publish compatibility/fit guidance and bundle-ready PDP updates.
3. Establish analytics/payment baseline with denominator checks.
4. Start capped own-site + constrained Etsy probe tests with daily CAC/CVR tracking.
5. Finalize naming clearance path for shortlist candidate(s).

## E) Risk Watchlist

- Compatibility ambiguity can inflate returns.
- Missing payment/returns clarity can suppress conversion.
- Lack of measured CVR/CAC can delay decision-grade planning.
- Copy drift risk remains high in a medical-adjacent category unless guardrails are enforced.

## F) Data Quality Issues

- No decision-grade observed traffic/conversion data yet.
- No decision-grade returns and payment-success distributions yet.
