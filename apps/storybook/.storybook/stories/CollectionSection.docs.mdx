<Description>
This section is a Next.js client component that depends on CMS data loaders and server actions.
To keep the Vite-based UI Storybook lean and RSC-safe, the interactive examples now live in the
CMS Storybook instance. Use the composed Storybook (`pnpm --filter @apps/storybook dev:composed`)
to reach the CMS catalog and collection stories.

### Where to find the stories

- CMS Storybook: `Sections/Collection/*`
- Demo data: handled via MSW in the CMS instance
