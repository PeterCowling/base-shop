In the past, we received complaints that very mixed age groups in shared dorms sometimes made it harder for guests to settle in comfortably as a group. These concerns were often subjective and difficult to verify on a case-by-case basis, which put both guests and staff in a difficult position.\r\n\r\nTo reduce the likelihood of issues and to protect the overall dorm experience, we apply the policy more strictly during peak season, when occupancy is high and the margin for disruption is lower. At the start and end of the season—when the hostel is quieter and the operational risk is more manageable—we can sometimes be more flexible.\r\n\r\nWe recognise this won't suit everyone, but we believe it is the most consistent and fair approach for maintaining a comfortable environment for all guests.

    "subject": "Breakfast — Not Included (OTA Booking)",
    "body": "{{SLOT:GREETING}}\r\n\r\nThank you for your email.\r\n\r\nWe get questions about complimentary breakfast from time to time, and we're happy to explain the logic clearly.\r\n\r\n### 1) What breakfast is\r\n\r\nComplimentary breakfast is a **direct-booking benefit** that we include only for reservations made through **our own website**.\r\n\r\n### 2) Why it's not included on third-party reservations\r\n\r\nWhen a reservation is made through a third-party booking platform, that platform charges a **commission** for providing discovery, marketing, booking and payment infrastructure. This means we receive less for the same room and dates than we do when you book directly with us.\r\n\r\nTo keep pricing consistent and avoid penalising guests on platforms with noticeably higher listed rates, we apply a simple and transparent approach:\r\n\r\n* **Direct booking (our website):** we include breakfast as a thank-you for booking directly.\r\n* **Third-party booking:** breakfast is not included because part of the rate is effectively covering the platform's commission and services.\r\n\r\n### 3) What guests *do* get when booking via a third party\r\n\r\nThird-party platforms aren't \"worse\" — they deliver value in a different way. Guests who book through them typically benefit from things like:\r\n\r\n* **easy comparison** of properties, locations and prices in one place\r\n* **reviews and ratings** that help with decision-making\r\n* **multi-language / multi-currency** booking and payment\r\n* **centralised customer support** and reservation management\r\n* sometimes **loyalty rewards**, credits, or platform-specific promotions\r\n\r\nIn short: with a platform booking, part of what you pay supports the platform services you chose to use. With a direct booking, we can put that same value into an on-property benefit such as breakfast.\r\n\r\n### 4) Equivalent examples in other industries (same principle)\r\n\r\nThis \"channel benefit\" approach is common elsewhere:\r\n\r\n* **Airlines:** booking direct often includes added flexibility, easier changes, bonus points, or seat selection; third-party fares can be cheaper or easier to compare, but may have fewer included perks or more restrictions.\r\n* **Car rental:** direct bookings sometimes include an upgrade, additional driver, or more flexible amendments; aggregator sites offer comparison and sometimes coupons, but the rental company typically receives less after fees.\r\n* **Events / theatres:** buying from the venue can include better support and fewer add-on fees; ticket marketplaces bundle convenience, discovery, and their own service fees.\r\n* **Retail brands:** many brands offer \"direct purchase\" benefits (free shipping, free returns, gift wrapping, or loyalty points) that are not available when purchasing the same product through a marketplace that charges seller fees.\r\n\r\nIt's the same underlying trade-off: **marketplace convenience and infrastructure vs. direct-booking benefits from the provider**.\r\n\r\n### 5) What this means for your reservation\r\n\r\nBecause your reservation was made through a third-party booking platform, **breakfast is not included** in your rate.\r\n\r\nIf you would like breakfast during your stay, you are very welcome to add it on-site — just let us know and reception will explain the options.\r\n\r\nFor future stays, booking directly through our website ensures you receive all direct-booking benefits, including breakfast.

Some drivers sometimes find pull-outs or unmarked spaces, but rules change and fines are common. If you want to try your luck, do it only if you can also afford the backup plan (a paid garage). One location sometimes mentioned by drivers is Plus Code JFJG+2X Positano, SA — please treat this as a \"maybe,\" not a promise. Always check local signage and never block traffic or driveways.\r\n\r\nArriving without a car (ferry, bus, taxi/private transfer) — many guests choose this option to avoid the parking challenge entirely.\r\n\r\nFor full details on parking, ZTL rules, and arrival options: <https://hostel-positano.com/en/assistance/arriving-by-car>",

If rough seas pause the boats, you will need the bus.\r\n\r\n*By bus*\r\nClimb the stairs back up to the coastal road. The bus stop (blue/white sign on a metal pole) is on the opposite side of the road. The Laurito stop is approximately 10 minutes before the Positano Sponda stop on the return journey — position yourself near the door.\r\nThe bus drops you at Bar Internazionale / Chiesa Nuova. Walk just over 100 m in the direction the bus was heading, then take the steps up to the hostel.\r\n\r\nCritical: there are no ticket vendors near Laurito Beach. Buy your return bus ticket at Bar Internazionale before you leave the hostel. If you have no ticket and the boats are paused, your only option is a water shuttle back to Spiaggia Grande, then buy from a tabacchi.\r\n\r\nBuses can be full in summer; services run every 20–30 minutes.\r\n\r\nFor the step-by-step return guide:\r\n<https://hostel-positano.com/en/guides/laurito-beach-bus-back>",

Take the Monte Solaro chairlift (€16–€18 return) to the island's highest point. Return to Capri town for lunch and the Giardini di Augusto (€1–€2) overlooking the Faraglioni rocks.\r\n\r\n*Blue Grotto*\r\nEntry €14–€18 plus a rowboat fee. Important: confirm the grotto is actually operating before joining the queue — operators sometimes sell tickets even when it is closed due to swell.\r\n\r\n*Via Krupp*\r\nThis scenic footpath is frequently closed due to rockfall. Check locally before planning your route around it.\r\n\r\n*Budget*\r\nAllow €70–€120 per person for ferry, chairlift, entry fees, and a light lunch.

Here is what to do.\r\n\r\n**When cancellations happen**\r\n\r\n   - Sailings are typically suspended when winds exceed 20 knots or swell exceeds 1.5 m (~5 ft)\r\n   - Check operator websites (Travelmar, Alilauro, NLG) and port display boards every 30 minutes on windy days\r\n   - Morning sailings are the most reliable; avoid relying on the last boat when storms are forecast\r\n\r\n**Land backup route**\r\n\r\n   - For Amalfi/Salerno: take the SITA bus from Chiesa Nuova (eastbound, sea-view side); buy ticket at Bar Internazionale or tabacchi\r\n   - For Sorrento/Naples: take the SITA bus (westbound, mountain side); connect to Circumvesuviana at Sorrento\r\n   - Allow at least 60 minutes buffer when switching to buses — they can arrive full in peak season\r\n\r\n**Refunds**\r\n\r\n   - Keep your receipt or screenshot the QR code — show at the dock booth for a refund or rebooking\r\n   - For bookings made through an online agency: email the cancellation notice screenshot within 24 hours\r\n\r\n**If you are already away from Positano**\r\n\r\n   - Notify your accommodation as soon as delays are announced\r\n   - Ask the port information point about shared taxis or substitute shuttles\r\n\r\nFull guide including insurance tips:\r\n<https://hostel-positano.com/en/guides/ferry-cancellations>",
