# Market Intelligence Pack: HEAD (Refresh 2026-02-20)

## A) Executive Summary

- HEAD demand signal remains strongest in caregiver-led routines where secure wear and loss prevention matter daily.
- Manufacturer ecosystems validate core jobs (retention, storage, water-day routines), while independent brands validate textile pricing and style-driven demand.
- The highest-confidence 90-day extension lane is non-medical textile + organisation + personalisation:
  - multi-pack headbands,
  - organiser pouch,
  - patch packs.
- Naming strategy should stay lifestyle-first and coined; clinic-coded generic strings are strategically weak for this category.
- Channel posture remains decision-locked: own-site DTC primary with constrained Etsy probes.

## B) Evidence Separation

### Checked (public evidence references in source artifacts)

- Manufacturer and retailer accessory catalogs across retention/storage/water-use
- Independent competitor assortment and pricing patterns
- Italy/global CI installed-base directional references
- EU MDR intent/accessory framing implications for marketing language
- Naming-landscape evidence showing clinic-coded gravity of "hearing/ear solutions" string patterns

### Inferred

- Top adjacent categories for a small DTC model
- Claim-drift risk heuristic by category
- Bundle architecture likely to improve AOV and reduce single-SKU fragility

### Unknown without additional work

- Supplier COGS and MOQ by material/hardware
- Child-safety engineering pass for tether systems
- Final legal treatment of specific SKUs and claims language
- Final TM/domain clearance on shortlisted names

## C) Customer Jobs (Condensed)

Top recurring jobs in Italy-first context:
1. Keep processor secure during movement.
2. Reduce pull-off/loss disruption for young children.
3. Make school/caregiver handoffs reliable.
4. Improve organisation of small accessories.
5. Maintain calmer bedtime/travel routines.
6. Support personal style without concealment framing.

## D) Competitor and Price Corridor Signals

Observed anchors across currently visible listings:
- Value textile headbands around EUR12-16
- Specialist/manufacturer retention and sport accessories around EUR30-50+
- Case/storage accessories from ~EUR15 to ~EUR50+

Practical implication:
- HEAD can sustain an accessible-premium range if it wins on coherence, guidance quality, and bundle design rather than commodity pricing.

## E) Naming Intelligence Summary

Recommended naming direction:
- Territory B (lifestyle/everyday normalisation) with coined masterbrand.

Why:
- Minimises clinic confusion and claim-drift pressure.
- Scales across future accessories beyond headbands.
- Supports Italy-first tone and later EU/US extension.

Current shortlist artifact:
- `docs/business-os/strategy/HEAD/2026-02-20-candidate-names.user.md`

## F) Channel and Execution Implications

- Primary channel surface: own-site DTC.
- Secondary channel mode: constrained Etsy probes.
- Amazon remains deferred unless trigger conditions reopen channel decision.
- Community referral channels should be treated as high-trust, low-CAC complements.

## G) Risk Register (Condensed)

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation direction |
|---|---|---|
| Copy drift into medical/outcome language | High | Enforce non-medical copy guardrails |
| Child safety risk for tether-class products | High | Defer until engineering + warning standards pass |
| CAC drift on low-AOV mix | High | Bundle optimisation + strict spend gates |
| Fit ambiguity driving returns | High | Compatibility/fit guidance + support path |

## H) Startup-Loop Hand-off

## I) Evidence Addendum — External Research (2026-02-20)

This section adds externally-researched data not present in the original market intel pack. All items tagged `research-checked` are sourced from public references.

### I.1 Scale and Demographics (research-checked)

| Metric | Figure | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Italian CI installed base | ~17,000–20,000 users | MDPI 2024/2025 Italian incidence study; brand dossier |
| New Italian implants/year (2023) | ~1,595 (27 per million inhabitants) | MDPI 2024/2025 |
| European CI users | ~500,000 | EURO-CIU |
| New European implants/year | ~25,000 | EURO-CIU |
| European adult/paediatric split | ~60% adult / 40% paediatric | EURO-CIU |
| Global installed base (2019) | ~737,000 | NIDCD |
| Italian children implanted before 24 months | ~55% | PMC 9935678 (Italian survey) |
| Median age at implantation (children, global) | ~16 months | PMC 9913281 |

**Implication**: The caregiver segment begins at/before age 2 and persists for ~10 years per child. Italy generates ~1,600 new patients/year (ongoing market refresh). EU total provides viable scale for expansion.

### I.2 Manufacturer Market Share (research-checked, global)

| Manufacturer | Global share | Europe notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cochlear Limited (AUS) | ~50–55% | Global leader; strong UK/ANZ/US |
| MED-EL (Austria) | ~20–25% | Stronger in Central/Southern Europe; acquired Oticon Medical implant assets Dec 2024 |
| Advanced Bionics (US/CH) | ~15–20% | Consistently third; Geneva HQ, EU manufacturing |

**Italy note**: No Italy-specific breakdown found. MED-EL's home-market advantage in Central/Southern Europe suggests its Italian share is likely above the global 20–25%. All three brands appear in Italian clinical literature. Products from all three brands must be considered in compatibility guidance.

### I.3 Competitor Detail — Third-Party Retention Products (research-checked)

| Brand | Product | Price | Key notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Geniebands (Etsy) | Sports-pocket headband | ~USD20–30 est. | 9,156 total Etsy shop sales, 500 reviews, 4.8/5; 6 sizes (6m–adult); Oeko-Tex certified fabric; 35+ countries; strongest third-party WTP signal |
| Ear Suspenders | Silicone grip retention headband | ~USD18.50–19.50 | ~29.9k total Etsy sales, 4.7 rating, ~2.1k reviews; on Etsy since 2011; adjustable sizing, non-slip silicone — operational maturity benchmark |
| Ear Gear | Spandex sleeve/cover | ~USD29.99–38 | Addresses sweat/moisture; cross-compatible across Cochlear/AB/Oticon Medical/MED-EL explicitly; documented complaints: too tight, changes processor programme |
| SyNAPS | Bluesign/Oeko-Tex headband/hat | Not yet scraped | Non-slip silicone, moisture-wicking; new entrant |
| Deafmetal | Jewellery-style retention accessories | ~USD54–60+ | Adult/teen identity; child-safety constraints |
| SmartEAR (Italian retailer) | Universal cotton pocket headband | EUR18 | Italian-language listing; side pockets; child use cases described; sold via Italian hearing-products retailer — confirms Italian-language retail exists but is retailer-distributed, not DTC lifestyle-brand |

**WTP confirmation**: Third-party functional retention products sell at EUR18–USD38. Decorative/identity accessories (CI bling, Etsy) sell at USD2.50–20.

**Italian retail gap clarification**: Italian-language accessibility for retention accessories exists via hearing-product distributors and marketplaces. The defensible gap is the absence of a cohesive, lifestyle-coded, cross-compatible DTC brand with Italian-first UX — not the total absence of Italian-language product.

### I.4 Documented Comfort Failure Modes (research-checked)

These are confirmed in public sources and should inform product spec and copy:

- **Pressure on magnet site**: Cochlear own support documentation states headbands can place "pressure on your processor" causing soreness, numbness, or heat at the implant site.
- **Heat and sweat**: MED-EL sports headband explicitly markets breathability (implies non-breathable options cause heat); Ear Gear product exists specifically because wearers suffered sweat damage (one reviewer replaced processors "4–5 times due to sweat damage" before using sleeve).
- **Skin irritation / contact dermatitis**: BCIG Skin Health Information Leaflet (September 2023) published formally; contact dermatitis to silicone is a documented clinical condition post-implantation.
- **Inconsistent positioning**: HearingTracker forum: Snugfit "doesn't settle into one right position which it will consistently go to."
- **Glasses incompatibility**: Ear Gear attachment "pulls glasses into a weird angle" (forum); glasses arm creates uncomfortable "lumpy bumpy area."
- **Hair and coil displacement**: coil wire catches on hair; some centres require shaving over the magnet site as a retention intervention.

### I.5 Active Communities (research-checked)

| Community | Platform | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| HearPeers | forum.hearpeers.com | MED-EL hosted but cross-brand; active accessory and retention threads |
| HearingJourney | hearingjourney.com | Described as largest dedicated CI forum; parent sub-section active |
| HearingTracker Forum | forum.hearingtracker.com/c/cochlear-implants | Independent; specific retention-methods thread with product comparisons |
| CI Facebook groups | Facebook | ~18,000+ members across 60 groups (2015 baseline; higher now); parent groups active |

**Note**: Primary English-language communities. HearPeers is a promoted community asset in the manufacturer ecosystem (MED-EL explicitly directs users to it on its corporate community page — not just a generic forum). Italian-language equivalent not yet identified, but APIC (Associazione Portatori Impianto Cocleare) is an established Italian CI user non-profit association (volunteer, founded in Turin) that functions as a potential community hub for partnership outreach and qualitative discovery.

### I.6 Daily Kit (what users carry) (research-checked)

Understanding the organisation job-to-be-done requires knowing what's in the kit:

**Core daily carry:**
- Spare coil (external magnetic disc) — documented as the most commonly lost single item
- Spare batteries (disposable 675, 3–6 day life) or rechargeable battery pack
- Safety cord / retention lanyard
- Retention device (headband, sleeve, or clip)

**Bag additions:**
- Mini drying kit / desiccant pot
- Cleaning brush / wax pick
- Spare earhook or tubing
- Processor carry case / pouch (for when processor is off)

**For children / travel / active use:**
- Aqua/waterproof sleeve or case (swimming)
- Portable power pack
- Teacher/carer instruction card ("what to do if processor falls off")
- Spare processor (where programme provides one)

**Organisation implication**: The kit is 6–12 items minimum. No lifestyle product currently provides a coherent "daily kit system" at accessible pricing. This is the organisation gap.

### I.7 Validated Accessory Category Evidence (S0B live research, 2026-02-20)

The following accessory categories are validated by direct evidence in the CI ecosystem — not inferred. Relevant for range architecture decisions.

- **Pocket headband (retention)**: UK NHS patient page explicitly recommends "headbands with pockets" and breathable material to prevent overheating. Third-party purchase is treated as routine (third-party providers listed on NHS page).
- **Identity/label accessories**: Cochlear sells "Bilateral Identification Adhesive Labels" (colour-coded stickers to differentiate L/R processors) — direct validation that identity/personalisation accessories are a real purchase category in this ecosystem.
- **Organiser/carry case**: Cochlear sells a storage case sized to hold two sound processors with cables/accessories — validates organiser and carry products as part of the standard CI accessory set.
- **Breathability as clinical requirement**: NHS guidance explicitly states headbands must be breathable to avoid overheating the skin. Oeko-Tex certification is already used as a trust marker by Geniebands (explicit in shop copy). Both are first-order product requirements, not optional.
- **Italian B2B distributor channel**: An Italian hearing-products distributor catalogues Cochlear safety lines and MED-EL protective cases behind a login-to-see-price model — confirms B2B/B2B2C distribution exists in Italy but is access-restricted, reinforcing that open DTC is an underserved layer.

### I.8 Regulatory Timeline (S0B live research, 2026-02-20)

Time-sensitive regulatory milestones relevant to HEAD's 2026 launch year:

| Regulation | Status | HEAD implication |
|---|---|---|
| EU MDR (Reg. (EU) 2017/745) | In force | "Intended purpose" on labels/copy determines MDR accessory scope. Copy discipline is non-negotiable from day one. |
| Eudamed actor registration | **Mandatory from 28 May 2026** | HEAD's launch window overlaps this deadline. If products are classified as MDR accessories, Eudamed registration is required. Monitor classification decision. |
| EU GPSR (Reg. (EU) 2023/988) | Applicable from 13 December 2024 | Applies to all children's wearable products regardless of MDR status. Requires documented hazard identification, traceability, and warnings where needed. |
| EN 14682 | Standard | Governs cords/drawstrings in children's clothing. Applies to any tether-class or corded component around children's neck/head region. Reinforces tether deferral gate. |
| Textile labelling (Reg. (EU) 1007/2011) | In force | Italy-facing products must display fibre composition in Italian, in descending proportion order, without abbreviations. |
| REACH (SVHCs) | In force | Duty to communicate if candidate-list substances exceed thresholds in articles. Standard baseline for any EU textile accessory brand. |
