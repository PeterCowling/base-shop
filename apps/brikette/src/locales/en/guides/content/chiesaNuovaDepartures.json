        "It is a 120 metre (400 foot) walk from the hostel entrance to the bus stop on Viale Pasitea, the main coastal road through Positano. The walk takes 2–4 minutes on a gentle downhill slope with paved sidewalks all the way. You will see the hostel sign on your right as you leave. The sidewalk is wide enough for luggage and has good lighting at night.",
        "If you are going to Amalfi (east), the stop is across from Bar Internazionale on the sea-view side of the road. Wait here for buses to Amalfi town, Salerno, and Ravello. If you are going to Sorrento (west), you will wait right outside the bar on the mountain side of the road. Look for the blue and white SITA bus stop sign.",
        "This Chiesa Nuova stop is the closest SITA bus stop to Hostel Brikette and the easiest place to catch buses along the coast. Locals also call it the Bar Internazionale stop. The bar has a large red awning that makes it easy to spot from either direction."

From Amalfi, you can continue to %LINK:salernoPositano|Salerno% (additional 45 minutes) or take connecting buses to Ravello.",
        "**Towards Sorrento (westbound):** Buses wind along the coast through several scenic tunnels before reaching %LINK:sorrentoGuide|Sorrento% (40–50 minutes). From Sorrento, you can connect to trains heading to %LINK:naplesPositano|Naples% (Circumvesuviana line to Naples Central Station) or continue to Naples Airport.",

        "SITA buses run often between Positano and both Amalfi and Sorrento during peak season (April–October). Expect buses every 20–30 minutes during the day, with fewer buses in the early morning (before 8am) and evening (after 9pm). The ride takes about 40 minutes to Amalfi and 50 minutes to Sorrento, but can take longer during busy summer days when traffic is heavy.",
        "**First buses:** The first bus going east to Amalfi usually leaves Chiesa Nuova around 6:30–7:00am. The first bus going west to Sorrento usually leaves around 6:45–7:15am. Check the current times at Bar Internazionale or ask at hostel reception because the schedule changes with the seasons. In summer there are more buses than in winter.",
        "**Last buses:** Evening buses get much less frequent after 10pm. The last bus to Amalfi usually leaves around 10:30pm, and the last bus to Sorrento leaves around 11pm. Always check the exact times at reception or look at the SITA schedule posted at the stop. Try to catch the second-to-last bus if you are traveling at night so you do not miss the last one and get stuck.",
        "**Winter schedules (November–March):** Buses run less often in winter, about every 40–60 minutes, and the last buses leave earlier. Some evening buses may not run at all on Sundays or public holidays. Always check the winter schedule before you travel."

Do not try to board the bus without a ticket you bought first—you cannot buy tickets from the driver. The tabacchi usually opens at 7am and closes at 8pm.",
        "**Ticket prices (2026):** A single trip from Positano to Amalfi costs €2.50. Positano to Sorrento costs €2.50. Positano to Salerno (going through Amalfi) costs €4.00. A 24-hour Costiera pass costs €8.00 and lets you take as many buses as you want between Sorrento and Salerno. The day pass is a good deal if you plan to take more than three trips in one day.",
        "**Validation:** Show your ticket to the driver when you get on the bus. The driver will stamp it with the date and time. On newer buses, you can scan your ticket at the machine just inside the door. Keep your stamped ticket for the whole ride—ticket checkers often get on the bus and check tickets. If you do not have a stamped ticket, you will get a fine right away that costs much more than the ticket.",
        "**Buy ahead:** If you are catching the first bus in the morning (before 7:30am), buy your ticket the night before because the tabacchi may not be open yet. Come to hostel reception if you need to check out early. The bar also sells tickets and opens earlier than the tabacchi, usually by 6:30am.",

        "**Arrive early in summer:** Summer buses (June–September) often fill up completely, especially during busy times like mid-morning (9am–12pm) and late afternoon (4pm–7pm). Get to the stop at least 10–15 minutes before your bus to get a good spot near the front of the line. If the bus is full, it may not stop at all and you will have to wait for the next one.",
        "**Queue rules:** Make a clear line near the bus shelter on the right side of the road. Do not push or crowd—Italians usually respect the line order. When the bus comes, wait for people to get off before you get on. The driver may close the door if people try to push ahead.",
        "**Luggage:** There is not much room for luggage on SITA buses—usually just a small space at the back or under the seats. If you have big backpacks or suitcases, try to board early to get a luggage spot. Think about using a %LINK:porterServices|porter service% to carry your luggage to your next place if you have heavy bags. Most buses only have room for 4-5 large bags in the back compartment.",
        "**Standing room:** On full summer buses, you may need to stand for part or all of the ride. The coastal road has many turns and sharp corners, so hold on tight to the bars above your head or the seat backs. The driver may brake hard if a car stops suddenly ahead."

Total journey time: approximately 2 hours. See our %LINK:positanoNaplesCenterBusTrain|complete Positano to Naples guide% for schedules and platform information.",
        "**To Naples Airport:** Follow the Naples route above, then take the Alibus shuttle from Naples Central Station to the airport (20 minutes). Alternatively, book a direct shuttle from Positano—ask at reception. Our %LINK:naplesAirportPositanoBus|Naples Airport guide% covers all options.",
        "**To Salerno:** Take the eastbound bus towards Amalfi (35 minutes), then continue on the same or a connecting bus to Salerno (45 minutes).

Ferries are faster and more scenic than buses but cost 2–3 times more. See our %LINK:ferrySchedules|ferry schedules guide% for timetables and our %LINK:briketteToFerryDock|walking route to the dock%.",
        "**Private transfer/taxi:** Expect to pay €80–150 for a private car to Sorrento or Amalfi, €150–200 to Naples Airport, and €100–140 to Salerno. Taxis can be booked at reception. Worth considering if you have heavy luggage or are traveling as a group of 3–4 people.",
        "**Scooter rental:** Experienced riders can rent a scooter in Positano and drive the coastal road themselves. See our %LINK:scooterRentalPositano|scooter rental guide% for rental shops, pricing, and safety tips. Not recommended for nervous riders—the SS163 coastal road is narrow and winding with heavy traffic in summer."
