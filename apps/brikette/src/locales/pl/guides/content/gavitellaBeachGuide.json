  "intro": [
    "Gavitella Beach Praiano is the coast’s “sunset beach”: the small cove faces west, so you get long afternoon light and golden-hour views back toward Positano and Capri.",
    "Most of the waterfront is run by two lidos (beach clubs) — La Gavitella and One Fire — plus a slim public strip carved into the rock between them. In high season, space is limited and reservations matter.",
    "This guide is written for Hostel Brikette guests. From the hostel desk, we see the same two mistakes every week: people overpack for the stairs, and people stay for sunset without a return plan. We’ll help you avoid both.",
    "It focuses on the practical stuff: the staircase down from Piazza San Gennaro, how to time your day so you are not stranded after sunset, what to pack (water shoes are non‑negotiable), and how to choose between a calm lunch club vs a party setup.",
    "Quick rule of thumb: arrive earlier than you think, swim before the crowds and the wind pick up, and decide your “return plan” before you commit to sunset events."

        "Gavitella sits below Praiano’s Piazza San Gennaro. Roughly 400 steps weave past villas and lemon terraces to a stone platform, a pebble shelf, and a narrow public strip between the two lidos.",
        "La Gavitella occupies the left-hand side (facing the sea) with restaurant tables, sun decks, and moorings for tender boats. One Fire lines the right-hand pier with bright loungers, a DJ podium, and a dock for their party boats.",
        "It helps to think of the cove as two experiences: a classic “Amalfi Coast lunch and swim” on the La Gavitella side, and a louder, social afternoon at One Fire. Both can be fun — but if you show up expecting a big free sandy beach, you will be disappointed.",
        "Hostel reality check: the steps are what make the place special (fewer day-trippers), but they also make it easy to overpack. Keep your bag light and plan your return before sunset."
