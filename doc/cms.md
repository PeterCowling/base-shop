# CMS Navigation Guide

This document describes how to navigate the in-browser CMS and what each link in the sidebar does.

## Sidebar Links

The sidebar inside the CMS provides quick access to different sections:

- **Dashboard** – Shows shop statistics and pending account requests.
- **Products** – Lists all products. If a shop is selected, also shows **New Product**.
- **Pages** – Lists pages for the current shop with a **New Page** link when a shop is selected.
- **Media** – Upload and manage media files.
- **Settings** – Shop settings. When a shop is active an additional **SEO** option appears.
- **Live** – Opens a list of running shop instances.
- **RBAC** – (Admin only) Manage user roles.
- **Account Requests** – (Admin only) Approve new user accounts.
- **Create Shop** – (Admin only) Launch the wizard for creating a new shop.

Links such as **New Product**, **New Page** and **SEO** only appear after picking a shop, otherwise they are hidden.

## Switching Shops

Use the shop selector in the top bar to change which shop you are editing. The selector fetches available shops from `/api/shops` and updates the current route accordingly. Once you select a shop, the sidebar links update to include actions specific to that shop.

## Admin‑only Routes

Certain pages are restricted to users with the `admin` role:

- `/cms/rbac` – user management and role assignment.
- `/cms/account-requests` – approve pending sign‑ups.
- `/cms/wizard` – step‑by‑step workflow for creating a new shop.

Attempting to access these pages without the proper role will redirect back to the CMS dashboard.
