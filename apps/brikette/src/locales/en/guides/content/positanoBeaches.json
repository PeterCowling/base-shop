    {
      "question": "Which Positano beach is best for budget travellers?",
      "answer": "Fornillo is the most budget-friendly option with loungers starting around €15 and a larger free section than the main beach. It’s also calmer and a favourite among hostel guests."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any free beaches near Positano?",
      "answer": "Yes. Most beaches have at least some public space (often signed as “spiaggia libera”), but where it is and how big it feels can change by season. In Positano, Fornillo is usually the easiest place to find a bigger free area."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get to Arienzo or Laurito beach?",
      "answer": "Both beaches are easiest by shuttle boat from Spiaggia Grande. Arienzo has hundreds of stairs if you walk, and Laurito has limited land access. If you want the simple option, book a package that includes boat transfer."
    },
    {
      "question": "What time should I arrive at the beaches?",
      "answer": "For popular spots like Fornillo and Spiaggia Grande, arrive by 9–10am to grab a good spot in the free area. Fiordo di Furore fills up quickly because it’s small, so go early or outside peak hours."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much do beach loungers cost in Positano?",
      "answer": "Prices vary by club and season. Budget clubs at Fornillo can start around €15. Mid-range options at Spiaggia Grande often start around €25. Premium decks can be much higher. Arienzo packages that include boat transfer and food can start around €60."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I take a day trip to beaches outside Positano?",
      "answer": "Yes. Praiano (Gavitella and Marina di Praia), Fiordo di Furore, Sorrento’s Regina Giovanna swimming spot, and Amalfi are all popular day-trip options by bus or ferry. Check the linked guides for the easiest route from the hostel."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I bring to the beach?",
      "answer": "Bring water shoes (pebbles), sunscreen, a refillable bottle, and a bit of cash. If you want the free area, bring a thicker towel/mat, snacks, and something for shade."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which beach has the best sunset views?",
      "answer": "Gavitella in Praiano is well-known for sunset aperitivi. Laurito can also get late-day sun, especially if you use the boat shuttle and time it right."
