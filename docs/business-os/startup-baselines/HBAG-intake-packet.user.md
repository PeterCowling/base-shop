# HBAG Intake Packet

## A) Intake Summary

- Business idea: launch premium Birkin-style mini handbags as fashion accessories, starting with bag charm (H1) and AirPod holder (H2) variants. Five product angles identified; top two prioritised for demand test. (`observed`)
- Product 1 is defined: mini handbag in Birkin-style body (structured, multi-colour, gold hardware, leather-look exterior) worn as a bag charm on full-size handbag strap; positioned at €80–€150. (`observed`)
- Product 2 direction exists: same physical body repurposed as AirPod/small items holder with clip attachment; AirPod fit confirmed (TASK-03 complete 2026-02-17). (`observed`)
- Primary initial buyer hypothesis is fashion-conscious women 25–40 who own aspirational handbags and follow accessory trends. (`observed/inferred`)
- Physical product exists; supplier is China-based; unit cost and MOQ not yet confirmed (TASK-02 pending). (`observed`)
- Demand proven via WhatsApp orders (quantity TBC). Moving orders off WhatsApp onto owned channel (Caryina website) is the primary near-term execution step. (`observed`)
- Launch-surface mode: `pre-website` transitioning to own-site first. Website (new app) is primary channel; Etsy and Instagram/TikTok are parallel channels. (`observed`)
- In-destination channel (Brikette hostel + Positano boutiques) is a seasonal opportunity (June–September); operator is based in Positano, Amalfi Coast. (`observed`)
- Core near-term execution risk is supply chain cost visibility and product quality perception in photography — not lack of category demand, which is well-evidenced. (`inferred`)
- Brand positioning tier decided: **Premium €80–€150** (Pete confirmed 2026-02-17). (`observed`)
- Business unit HBAG was recently separated from XA for independent planning. Customer-facing brand name selected: **Caryina** (Pete confirmed 2026-02-21). (`observed`)
- Naming research complete (2026-02-20–21). Three rounds of candidate generation; name selected: **Caryina**. Domain registration and TM pre-screen required before brand setup. (`observed`)

| Recommended launch price H2 | €119 (same body, tech-functional framing; same premium tier) | observed |
| Price architecture | <€100 — "obvious yes"; €110–€139 — hesitate, needs visible craft/material story; €160+ — high friction without brand proof | observed |
| COGS target | ~€35/unit at €99 sell price; net retained ~€52–57/unit after Etsy fees + payment processing + packaging (subject to TASK-02 confirmation) | inferred |
| Style direction | 2026 market pivot: craft/material authenticity, vintage-inspired, no logos, natural textures; position as "one considered charm that elevates the bag" — not playful or novelty | observed |

## C) ICP and Channel Packet

| Field | Value | Tag |
|---|---|---|
| First-buyer ICP | Fashion-conscious women 25–40 who own designer or aspirational handbags, follow Instagram/TikTok accessory trends, and are comfortable spending €80–€150 on a considered purchase | observed/inferred |
| ICP context | Bag charm trend is 12× JOOR wholesale growth H1 2025; Pinterest +700%. This ICP actively seeks artisan fashion accessories and discovers via visual social channels. | observed |
| ICP job-to-be-done | Express personal style via bag accessories at a premium price that feels considered but not extravagant; find a unique artisan piece not in mass retail | inferred |
| ICP buyer failure states | Status quo options fail this ICP: looks/feels cheap, damages the bag strap, looks tacky, photographs poorly on social, breaks quickly | observed |
| Secondary ICP-A | International tourists visiting Amalfi Coast (2.3M annual visitors; fashion/accessories = 12.2% of Italy tourist spend); in-destination purchase window June–Sept | observed |
| Secondary ICP-B | Gift buyers purchasing for women who fit the primary ICP (milestone gifts, birthdays, Christmas self-treat) | inferred |
| Secondary ICP-C | Dog-owner women (H4 variant, deferred post-checkpoint) | inferred |
| Planned channels (initial) | Etsy (primary DTC — pre-website, no infrastructure required); Instagram/TikTok (discovery and demand probe via "DM to buy" CTA) | observed |
| Planned channels (seasonal) | In-destination: Brikette hostel reception + 1 Positano boutique consignment (H3 location variant, June–Sept only) | observed |
| Planned channels (B2B hospitality) | O9 extension: approach 2–3 Positano boutique hotels with physical samples during tourist season; complements in-destination activation; decision cycle 4–12 weeks | observed |
| Support expectation | Low-volume manual responses at launch (solo operator Pete); photo + sizing questions expected; AirPod model compatibility a key query | inferred |

## D) Constraints and Assumptions Register

| Item | Type | Evidence / note | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit cost, MOQ, and China→EU shipping are unknown | observed | TASK-02 pending; margin stack cannot be confirmed before supplier quote | High |
| Product quality reads as premium in photography | assumption | TASK-06 perception test planned: ≥3/5 cold reviewers must estimate ≥€80 for H1 lead photo | Medium |
| Etsy premium pricing (€80+) is accepted by buyers in this category | assumption | Hermes/Chanel AirPod holders at $930/$950 prove buyer exists; white space at artisan tier €80–€150 confirmed | Medium |
| Tourist season window for in-destination trial is June–September | observed | Amalfi Coast seasonality; short window requires early boutique outreach (May) | High |
| AirPod holder fits current AirPods Pro and AirPods 4 | observed | Pete confirmed TASK-03 complete 2026-02-17 | High |
| CE marking not required for fashion accessory variants H1–H4 | observed | TASK-04 complete 2026-02-18: TSD Directive 2009/48/EC Annex I item 10 exclusion applies | High |
| H5 (children's first bag) requires GPSR + REACH compliance (~€1,000–3,000) before launch | observed | TASK-04 finding; no CE marking but product safety compliance required | High |
| Single operator (Pete); max 1–2 active channel experiments simultaneously | observed | Bandwidth constraint; H4 and H5 deferred until post-checkpoint | High |
| Business name selected: **Caryina** | observed | Pete confirmed 2026-02-21; domain registration and TM pre-screen required before brand setup | High |
| Brand positioning locked at premium €80–€150 | observed | Pete decision 2026-02-17; gates all photography, copy, and channel choices | High |
| IP/trade dress risk — Birkin-style silhouette | risk | 2025 Paris Judicial Court ruling affirmed Birkin shape protection; maintain fashion-accessory framing, avoid exact replica claim; do not use "Birkin" in product title or copy | High |
| REACH compliance required — metal hardware | constraint | Nickel and chromium VI limits apply to all metal clasps and rings on H1–H4 under REACH Annex XVII; supplier must confirm REACH compliance on hardware | High |
| EU GPSR (2023/988) applies to all variants | observed | General Product Safety Regulation applies from 13 December 2024; no CE marking needed for H1–H4 but GPSR documentation (responsible person, product traceability) required before EU market entry | High |
| EU €3 duty on sub-€150 parcels from July 2026 | observed | Interim duty applies to parcels valued under €150 entering EU from 1 July 2026; affects Etsy international shipping economics from summer 2026 | Medium |

## E) Draft Outcome Contract

- Outcome statement: Move Caryina from proven WhatsApp demand to a scalable owned channel (website + Etsy), validating that premium €80–€150 positioning converts at volume without manual order handling.
- Baseline (2026-02-17):
  - paid orders: 0
  - net revenue: €0
  - contribution margin: not measured (awaiting TASK-02 supplier quote)
  - return rate: not measured
- Target (90 days):
  - paid orders: 10 OR net revenue €500 — whichever comes first (conservative first-signal target)
  - contribution margin: ≥35% after all costs (Etsy fees, shipping, packaging, unit cost)
  - return rate: not yet applicable (no sales)
- By: 2026-05-17
- Owner: Pete
- Leading indicators:
  - weekly Etsy listing views and add-to-cart count
  - weekly Instagram/TikTok DM purchase inquiries and intent confirmations
  - in-destination sales count (weekly, June–Sept only)
  - weekly Etsy favourites per listing
- Decision link: `DEC-HBAG-01` — if 0 sales by 2026-04-17 (60-day gate): pause channel spend, run `/lp-do-replan` on pricing and variant selection before continuing
- Stop/Pivot guardrails:
  - if 0 sales across all active channels after 60 days: halt, replan variant selection and pricing
  - if fewer than 3 Etsy views/day after 14 days: investigate tags and title before waiting full 28 days
  - if perception test (TASK-06 VC-01) fails: do not proceed to listing; reshoot or reassess positioning

## F) Missing-Data Checklist

| China→EU shipping cost per unit at MOQ | Required for contribution margin at target retail price | Pete | Critical |

| Amalfi custom graphics capability (supplier) | Required to confirm H3 (location variant) is producible | Pete | Medium |
