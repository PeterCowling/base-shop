## (a) Business Context

Business: BRIK
App: reception
Business type: Boutique hostel, Positano, Amalfi Coast, Italy. Premium positioning — "the most expensive hostel in the world while remaining very busy." 58 total sellable beds across 10 dorm rooms and 2 private units. Peak season is summer (May–September). Operated by a small, mixed-language team (predominantly Italian-speaking staff).
App scope: On-site operational app for bar POS, cash management, stock accountability, and guest check-in/out. Built on Next.js/React with Firebase for real-time offline-capable data sync. Staff use it on shared touch hardware at the reception desk. The app handles end-of-shift till reconciliation, safe management, ingredient stock counts, general stock counts, variance flagging, and end-of-day close-out. All workflows must function correctly in offline or poor-connectivity conditions.
Operator-stated goal version: 1
Goal set on: 2026-02-28

## (b) Singular Goal (verbatim)

Singular goal: "BRIK's reception app should have world-class cash and stock accountability workflows: any staff member can complete reconciliations and stock counts correctly and confidently without manager coaching, variances are surfaced immediately with enough context to resolve them, and the end-of-day close-out is a zero-stress routine that confirms a clean shift or flags exactly what needs attention."

## (c) Domain-by-Domain Research Instructions

#### Cash Reconciliation UX

Context: The end-of-shift till and safe reconciliation workflow as experienced by staff. Covers how guided the process is, how quickly an average staff member can complete it correctly, how errors and discrepancies are presented, and how the interface prevents mistakes before they happen. Excludes broader audit visibility for managers (see Manager Audit Visibility) and the daily close-out sequence (see End-of-Day Close-Out).

Reference points provided by operator:
- Square POS end-of-day — guided drawer count with on-screen prompts and running total comparison
- Lightspeed Restaurant — step-by-step shift close with live expected vs. actual cash display
- Toast POS — shift summary with variance highlighted inline before confirmation
- Tevalis (UK hospitality POS) — role-aware close-out that only shows steps relevant to the current staff role

Research task:
For this domain, identify:
1. What does world-class look like right now (2025–2026)? Name 3–5 specific exemplars with concrete evidence of what makes them world-class in this domain.
2. What are the key indicators that distinguish world-class from merely good? List 5–8 measurable or observable indicators.
3. What is the minimum threshold — the lowest standard that could still be considered competitive — for a business of this type and scale?
4. What are the most common gaps between current-practice hospitality/boutique-hostel operators and world-class in this domain?

---

#### Stock Accountability

Context: The stock counting and variance detection workflow. Covers how staff perform counts (ingredient stock and general stock), how quickly a count can be completed per category, how variances are surfaced (timing, clarity, context), and how the system distinguishes between expected variance (spoilage, comp) and unexplained loss. Excludes cash handling and end-of-day sequences.

Reference points provided by operator:
- MarketMan (hospitality inventory) — mobile-first count workflow with category-by-category progress and immediate variance flag
- Sysco FoodPro — guided count with expected vs. actual inline and reason-code prompts for variances
- Deputy + Lightspeed integration — stock alert thresholds that notify before counts are due
- Orca (UK bar inventory) — count history with trend view so managers can see recurring variance patterns

Research task:
For this domain, identify:
1. What does world-class look like right now (2025–2026)? Name 3–5 specific exemplars with concrete evidence of what makes them world-class in this domain.
2. What are the key indicators that distinguish world-class from merely good? List 5–8 measurable or observable indicators.
3. What is the minimum threshold — the lowest standard that could still be considered competitive — for a business of this type and scale?
4. What are the most common gaps between current-practice hospitality/boutique-hostel operators and world-class in this domain?

---

#### Manager Audit Visibility

Context: What a manager can see after a shift: who completed what, when, and whether any variances were logged or left unresolved. Covers the speed and clarity of the audit trail, how unexplained variances are surfaced vs. buried, and whether a manager can confirm a clean shift in under 30 seconds. Excludes the staff-facing reconciliation UX (see Cash Reconciliation UX).

Reference points provided by operator:
- Lightspeed Analytics — shift audit view with staff attribution, cash summary, and variance flags in one screen
- Deputy Shift Reporting — per-staff activity log with timestamps for each action
- Toast Manager Dashboard — daily summary card showing any shifts with unresolved discrepancies highlighted in red
- Tevalis Back Office — searchable audit log with filter by staff member, date, and variance type

Research task:
For this domain, identify:
1. What does world-class look like right now (2025–2026)? Name 3–5 specific exemplars with concrete evidence of what makes them world-class in this domain.
2. What are the key indicators that distinguish world-class from merely good? List 5–8 measurable or observable indicators.
3. What is the minimum threshold — the lowest standard that could still be considered competitive — for a business of this type and scale?
4. What are the most common gaps between current-practice hospitality/boutique-hostel operators and world-class in this domain?

---

#### End-of-Day Close-Out

Context: The daily sequence that consolidates the shift: final cash count, float set for the next day, confirmation that stock is logged, and the system is reset for opening. Covers how automated vs. manual the sequence is, how clearly the system confirms a clean close vs. flags outstanding issues, and whether a correct close-out requires any manager intervention. Excludes mid-shift reconciliations (see Cash Reconciliation UX).

Reference points provided by operator:
- Square for Restaurants — automated end-of-day report emailed to owner with no manual steps if shift balanced
- Revel Systems — close-out checklist with each step marked complete/incomplete and a single "confirm close" action
- Lightspeed Restaurant — pre-close warnings surfaced before the manager attempts to close (missing voids, open tabs)
- Epos Now (UK) — manager-facing close summary showing float, sales, variance, and next-day float recommendation

Research task:
For this domain, identify:
1. What does world-class look like right now (2025–2026)? Name 3–5 specific exemplars with concrete evidence of what makes them world-class in this domain.
2. What are the key indicators that distinguish world-class from merely good? List 5–8 measurable or observable indicators.
3. What is the minimum threshold — the lowest standard that could still be considered competitive — for a business of this type and scale?
4. What are the most common gaps between current-practice hospitality/boutique-hostel operators and world-class in this domain?

Body: one top-level section per domain, using EXACTLY this heading format:
```
## [<domain_id>] <Domain Name>
```

Under each domain section, include ALL FOUR of these subsections:

### Current Best Practice
<2–4 paragraph description of what world-class looks like in this domain right now, with named exemplars>

### Exemplars
<Bullet list of 3–5 named exemplars with a one-sentence description of what makes each world-class in this domain>

### Key Indicators
<Bullet list of 5–8 measurable or observable indicators that distinguish world-class from merely good>

### Minimum Threshold
<1–2 sentences: the lowest bar a business of this type and scale must clear to be considered competitive in this domain>

Do not add extra sections. Do not merge domains. If a domain has no strong exemplars available, note that explicitly in the Exemplars section rather than omitting it.

## (e) Constraints for This Research

All findings, exemplars, and recommendations must be compatible with the following constraints.

- Staff skill varies widely — workflows must work for first-shift non-technical staff without prior training or manager coaching
- Shared hardware at a busy reception desk — every workflow must be completable in under 5 minutes; touch-friendly required
- App operates in offline or poor-connectivity conditions (Firebase offline sync) — workflows must not depend on live connectivity to complete
- Staff work primarily in Italian; any instructional or error text must be understandable to Italian-speaking staff

Research that violates these constraints (e.g. recommending cloud-only real-time sync solutions that break offline, or English-only guidance for Italian-speaking staff) should be explicitly flagged as out-of-scope and replaced with the closest in-scope alternative.
