HBAG Naming Framework Research
Current date: 20 February 2026 (Europe/Rome)

## Market Sizing and Demand Context

Public market sizing for "artisan bag accessories / bag charms" is not standardised because the category cuts across multiple taxonomies (handbags/leather goods, fashion accessories, jewellery/keyrings/charms, and—when used as an AirPods case—tech accessories). As a result, any single "bag charm market size" figure should be treated as method-dependent rather than definitive (inference).

A more defensible (and verifiable) approach is to triangulate from adjacent markets and from evidence of category momentum:

Published leather goods market sizes vary materially by publisher and scope. For example, Grand View Research reports a global leather goods market size of USD 253.82B in 2023 (with forward projections). Fortune Business Insights reports USD 531.07B in 2025, projecting USD 982.42B by 2034 (different scope/definition). Mordor Intelligence reports USD 476.17B in 2026, projecting growth to 2031.

Checked: these figures exist and are published by the named sources.
Inferred: variance likely reflects definitional differences (what product categories and channels are included).
Unknown without paid reports: each publisher's full segmentation methodology and how much is "bags vs other leather goods."

A related baseline is the broader bag market. ResearchAndMarkets summarises a "Bag Market" valued at USD 183.2B in 2024, projecting USD 291.9B by 2034. This indicates the scale of the host category that your primary customer already buys into, but it does not isolate micro-accessories.

What is more directly evidenced is that bag charms / "bag jewellery" are in a strong fashion cycle as a personalisation mechanism and "little luxury" purchase. A 2025 article in Le Monde describes the growing popularity of "bijoux de sac," framing them as a playful response to "quiet luxury" aesthetics and a more accessible way to participate in luxury signalling.

Inferred: this aligns with your functional + playful positioning (a serious bag made "mine" with a crafted accessory).

For the secondary ICP (international tourists on the Amalfi Coast), official tourism statistics rarely publish a single "daily spend for Amalfi/Positano tourists" number in openly accessible sources. What is verifiable from an authoritative dataset is Italy-wide inbound spend: Bank of Italy reports foreign traveller expenditure of €54.2B in 2024 and an average daily expenditure for overnight visitors of €135.6.

Checked: Italy-wide average daily spend exists in the survey table.
Inferred: high-spend destination tourists (e.g., Amalfi) may be above this national average.
Unknown without more granular data: Amalfi/Positano-specific daily spend, and the distribution by traveller segment.

## Competitive Naming Landscape

This landscape shows a split between (i) prestige-by-format naming (e.g., "Maison/Atelier" styles) and (ii) meaning-led naming (evocative words, origin stories, and invented marks that become meaning through brand building). The most crowded territories in premium accessories skew French-coded and/or eponymous.

A useful benchmark is Polène, a Paris-origin DTC brand whose naming mechanics illustrate what tends to work:

- The name is meaning-led and sensory: The Business of Fashion reports that Polène is "a play on the word 'pollen'," tied to a nature-oriented brand premise.
- The brand's own positioning foregrounds "know-how."
- The brand builds semantic memory through product names that function like mini-stories (e.g., "Numéro Dix," "Cyme," "Nodde"), making non-descriptive brand naming feel "legible" in-market.
- The brand is large enough that its naming likely benefits from social proof effects: Le Monde reported €142.7M sales in 2023 and €102.9M in 2022 (time-sensitive business context).
- As of the capture available in an Instagram embed, the Polène Instagram account shows 3,066,335 followers (time-sensitive).

Inference: a non-descriptive, story-led name can succeed in accessories if the product system and storytelling are coherent enough to "teach" the word.

Other verified competitor naming territories:

- **French "house" formality (crowded):** Maison de Sabré uses an explicit "Maison de …" construction; trade mark documentation provides the translation "HOUSE OF SABRE," signalling deliberate maison-coded prestige.
- **Place/nature + abstract noun (moderately crowded):** Cala Jade positions itself as Oslo-based and "devoted to… handcrafted leather bags and accessories," using brand voice like "timeless pieces with attitude."
- **Eponymous designer (crowded but historically strong):** Anya Hindmarch positions creativity, craftsmanship, and personalisation as core.
- **Origin/meaning word (works when credible):** Cuyana is widely described as deriving its name from a Quechua-related meaning associated with love/cherish.
- **Attitude compound / mythic founder story (open-ish):** KILLSPENCER frames "KILLSPENCER" as a metaphor for relentless craft pursuit; founder interview describes it as "a nod to… the constant pursuit of excellence in craftsmanship."

**Crowded vs open conclusions (evidence-backed inference):**

- Crowded: "Maison/Atelier" prestige-forms (Maison de X), generic place-name-only brands, and designer eponymous names without a real designer behind them.
- More open: short, Italian-phonetic coined marks; place-evocative but non-place-name marks; and craft-technique-derived words when they are not plainly descriptive. (Inference grounded in observed competitor clustering above.)

**Luxury-house accessory naming register**

You must also differentiate from luxury-house product naming conventions, where the parent brand carries the meaning and the accessory name is often motif/function.

Examples:

- Louis Vuitton uses "Vivienne" (house mascot) as a charm motif name in "My Vivienne bag charm."
- Hermès uses motif + category names like "Charm cheval," often within the "petit h" universe.
- Gucci uses hardware motif naming (e.g., "Half Horsebit bag charm," "Gucci Horsebit 1955 charm").
- CH Carolina Herrera explicitly uses functional naming "Charm for Airpods" under the parent brand.

Implication (inference): As an independent artisan brand, avoid functional-descriptor brand naming. Functional labels are fine as product descriptors, but the brand name needs to sit in a different register.

## Naming Territory Evaluation

Name directions below are illustrative (not final). For each territory: strategic logic, risks, distinctiveness spectrum position, and expansion fit beyond the initial "mini bag charm / AirPods holder" object.

### A: Place-rooted, non-trapping

Illustrative directions: **Riflesso, Sponda, Aurelia, Brina.**

Strategic logic: evokes coastal Italy through atmosphere (light, shoreline, travel) rather than "AMALFI" as a billboard, supporting boutique storytelling and tourist desirability (inference).

Risks: some words may collide with existing place brands, hospitality, or beauty products, weakening distinctiveness and raising clearance workload (inference).

Spectrum: typically suggestive (occasionally drifts toward descriptive if too literal).

Expansion fit: strong — works for straps, pouches, SLG, seasonal capsules.

### B: Craft and material language

Illustrative directions: **Brunito, Rifilo, Concia, Intarsia.**

Strategic logic: signals craft-forward positioning and "proof" (edge finishing, stitching, construction) in a way that resonates with buyers who value materiality (inference).

Risks: EU trade marks can be refused if a word is seen as descriptive/non-distinctive for the goods; EUIPO guidelines note that descriptive/non-distinctive elements lack distinctiveness.

Spectrum: suggestive → descriptive depending on how directly the term describes a characteristic/process of the goods.

Expansion fit: strong and believable beyond the hero product.

### C: Coined word with Italian phonetics

Illustrative directions: **Orivella, Veloria, Marevia, Cintara.**

Strategic logic: maximises distinctiveness and global scalability while still sounding "at home" in Italian retail contexts. The meaning is supplied by the maker story rather than by literal semantics (inference).

Risks: requires brand-building effort; early trust relies on craft execution and consistent storytelling. Polène demonstrates that consumers will learn an unfamiliar brand word if the product system is coherent.

Spectrum: coined.

Expansion fit: excellent (minimal product-form lock-in).

### D: Emotion or quality as a single word

Illustrative directions: **Carezza, Incanto, Sincera, Gioia.**

Strategic logic: builds immediate emotional resonance and warm tone in digital discovery contexts (inference).

Risks: common words are often harder to own; possible language descriptiveness objections and higher collision risk with existing marks in adjacent classes (beauty, hospitality, jewellery).

Spectrum: usually suggestive, sometimes "weakly distinctive" if widely used.

Expansion fit: good if the word is broad and positive.

### E: Paired words or compounds

Illustrative directions: **OroLuce, MareFilo, VeraForma, LuceRiva.**

Strategic logic: offers "built-in meaning" while remaining brand-like (more legible than a coined word) (inference).

Risks: two-word domains can be harder; combining descriptive terms can still fail distinctiveness if the overall impression remains descriptive.

Spectrum: usually suggestive, can drift into descriptive.

Expansion fit: good if the pair is conceptual (quality/place), not product-specific.

## Shortlisted Directions and Launch-Market Suitability

From the territories above, the 12 strongest testing candidates (not final names) are:

Brunito, Rifilo, Concia, Orivella, Veloria, Marevia, Cintara, Riflesso, Brina, Aurelia, Incanto, OroLuce.

Screening notes (phonetics, cross-language risk, and wordmark behaviour) are necessarily pre-clearance; final validation requires legal and linguistic review.

- **Brunito:** dictionary-defined Italian word and therefore easier to story (craft finishing). Treccani defines "brunito" as an adjective derived from "bruno." Risk: existing unrelated uses cause search "noise" (e.g., entertainment/music content).
- **Aurelia:** highly legible and elegant; risk: common personal-name/place associations likely raise collision risk (inference).
- **Riflesso / Brina / Sponda-style words:** strong atmospheric "photographic" association (inference), but place/commerce collisions are more likely than with coined marks (inference).
- **Coined set (Orivella / Veloria / Marevia / Cintara):** strongest likely path for distinctiveness and cross-market scalability, provided the brand voice anchors meaning (inference). Polène's naming and storytelling strategy supports this inference as a successful precedent.
- **OroLuce:** instantly boutique-legible and aligns with "gold hardware" visual cues (inference), but common-word components may reduce ownability.

## Domain and Trade Mark Risk Flags

This section distinguishes what was checked vs inferred vs unknown, and dates time-sensitive items (20 February 2026).

**What was checked**

Trade mark classes relevant to your goods:

- Class 18 covers leather and imitation leather goods including carrying bags.
- Class 14 explicitly includes key rings, key chains, and charms.
- Class 25 covers clothing/footwear/headwear.
- Official guidance on searching: EUIPO advises searching for existing marks via TMview. WIPO provides the Global Brand Database as a search access point.

**Tooling constraints:** Access to TMview was blocked (403) in this environment, preventing a full official search workflow here.

**Observed strong collisions for specific candidate directions (domain/brand presence):**

- "Carezza" is a strong existing signifier in Italy, used by "Carezza Dolomites" and other commerce sites.
- "Lunavia" is already used by consumer brands operating on lunavia.com and lunavia.it.

**What was inferred**

Coined single words with Italian phonetics are generally more ownable than common-language words, because they are less likely to be deemed descriptive and less likely to collide with existing marks (inference supported by EUIPO distinctiveness principles).

**What remains unknown without legal counsel**

Definitive domain availability for each short-listed name across .com, .eu, .it (status can change daily). Definitive trade mark clearance and likelihood-of-confusion assessment in Classes 18/14/25 (and adjacent classes), including similarity searches, not just exact matches. EUIPO's own materials and third-party practitioners emphasise that thorough searching is essential before filing.

**Risk flag table** (checked 20 February 2026)

| Direction | Domain risk (.com/.eu/.it) | Trade mark risk (18/14/25) | Confidence | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------|-------|
| Carezza | high | high | Checked | Strong existing association and active Italian usage; likely weak ownability for fashion accessories. |
| Lunavia | high | high | Checked | Active consumer brands on lunavia.com and lunavia.it. |
| Brunito | medium | medium | Checked/Inferred | Real Italian word (dictionary) and existing unrelated uses; clearance likely harder than coined. |
| Rifilo | unknown→medium | unknown | Inferred | Craft-term feel increases descriptiveness risk; needs clearance. |
| Concia | unknown→high | unknown→high | Inferred | Strongly process/material-adjacent; highest descriptiveness risk among craft terms. |
| Riflesso | unknown→medium | unknown | Inferred | Common-language; likely more collisions than coined. |
| Brina | unknown→medium | unknown | Inferred | Common-language; possible cross-category collisions (hospitality/beauty). |
| Aurelia | unknown→high | unknown→high | Inferred | Common personal name/place association likely increases collisions. |
| Incanto | unknown→medium | unknown | Inferred | Common-language; likely existing marks in adjacent lifestyle categories. |
| OroLuce | unknown→medium | unknown | Inferred | Compound of common words; may be weaker trade mark. |
| Orivella | unknown | unknown→low | Inferred | Coined; likely best ownability path, subject to clearance. |
| Veloria | unknown | unknown→low | Inferred | Coined; likely best ownability path, subject to clearance. |
| Marevia | unknown | unknown→low | Inferred | Coined; likely best ownability path, subject to clearance. |
| Cintara | unknown | unknown→low | Inferred | Coined; likely best ownability path, subject to clearance. |

## Recommended Shortlist and Forced-Choice Territory

**Distinctiveness spectrum summary**

| Direction | Primary territory | Spectrum | Core strength | Primary risk |
|-----------|------------------|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Veloria | coined | coined | differentiation + scalability | needs meaning-building |
| Orivella | coined | coined | differentiation + story flexibility | needs clearance |
| Marevia | coined | coined | destination-friendly without trapping | needs meaning-building |
| Cintara | coined | coined | warm, human phonetics | needs clearance |
| Riflesso | place-rooted | suggestive | visual/photographic story | common-word collisions |
| Brunito | craft/material | suggestive→descriptive | craft proof in the word | search noise + descriptiveness arguments |
| OroLuce | compound | suggestive | immediate boutique legibility | weaker ownability vs coined |

**Recommended shortlist** (ranked by differentiation, Italian/English accessibility, expansion headroom, plausible ownability):

1. Veloria
2. Orivella
3. Marevia
4. Cintara
5. Riflesso
6. Brunito
7. OroLuce

Excluded from recommendation despite strong phonetics:

- Carezza (heavy pre-existing associations in Italy).
- Lunavia (active brand/domain usage).

**Recommended territory — forced choice**

**Coined word with Italian phonetics, backed by a craft-proof narrative.**

In first-impression terms (Etsy/Instagram, inference): the name should feel like a small discovery — premium but human, not corporate; Italian in mouth-feel without leaning on generic "Italian leather" clichés; playful enough to sit beside a serious investment bag; and broad enough to expand into small leather goods and capsule drops. This approach also naturally avoids the luxury-house "motif/function under parent brand" naming register, positioning you as an independent maker brand rather than an accessory line.
