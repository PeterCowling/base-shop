# Pet Product — Brand Dossier

> **Draft status.** This dossier was bootstrapped from the business plan and forecast.
> No app or theme package exists yet. All visual identity fields are `TBD` with rationale.
> The category has not yet been narrowed from the broader "pet products" space —
> brand identity cannot be fully resolved until the primary product category is locked.
> All `TBD` fields require operator input after Category and Segment Prioritization (plan §Strategy item 2).

## Audience

**Primary:** TBD — pet owners in Italy. The specific pet type (dogs, cats, small animals) and the owner profile (age, lifestyle, purchase motivation) must be resolved as part of Category and Segment Prioritization.

**Secondary:** TBD — gift purchasers, specialty pet retailers (if wholesale applies).

**Device:** TBD — assumed mobile-first based on Italian e-commerce norms and comparable category benchmarks, but must be validated with first-party data.

**Context:** TBD — depends on the product category selected. High-intent search acquisition is planned; social (Instagram/TikTok for visual pet content) is a likely secondary channel. Emotional purchase drivers are expected (pet owners have strong affiliation with their animals); practical drivers (price, compatibility, safety) also apply.

**Key constraint:** Brand positioning cannot be completed until the product category is locked. "Pet Product" is a placeholder — the audience is different for dog accessories vs. cat toys vs. small-animal nutrition.

## Personality

> TBD — Directional candidates pending category lock:
> - If accessories (leash, collar, harness): **Practical + stylish**, approachable, quality-forward
> - If nutrition/treats: **Trustworthy + caring**, clean-ingredient focus, reassuring
> - If toys/enrichment: **Playful + warm**, energetic, fun
>
> Validate personality direction after category lock and ≥3 customer/community inputs.

Common to all candidate directions:
- **Warm**, not clinical (pet owners have emotional relationships with their animals)
- **Approachable**, not pretentious
- **Italy-native**, not translated from English templates

## Visual Identity

> TBD — No design work has been done. The following are directional notes only.
> Design system components and theme package creation are prerequisites for Active status.

### Color Palette

| Role | Token (proposed) | Rationale |
|------|-----------------|-----------|
| Primary | TBD | Depends on category. Accessories: warm earth tones or a distinctive accent. Nutrition: clean greens or natural tones. Toys: brighter, playful. Validate vs. competitor visual differentiation in Italy market. |
| Primary soft | TBD | Tinted card/highlight background |
| Accent | TBD | Complementary to primary; avoid generic "pet brand" blue/orange unless differentiated positioning requires it |
| Background | TBD | Clean and light; should feel premium for an Italy market product |

**Palette mood:** TBD — candidate direction after category lock.

### Typography

| Role | Token (proposed) | Rationale |
|------|-----------------|-----------|
| Body + headings | TBD | Friendly, readable, not corporate. Italian shoppers respond well to warm geometric sans-serif. |

### Shape & Elevation

> TBD — follow decision on category and app design after S7.

### Token Rationale

> Token rationale will be populated when the theme package is created. No theme package exists yet.

| Token | Design rationale |
|-------|-----------------|
| _(all TBD)_ | No app or theme package exists. Populate when created via `/lp-design-spec`. |

### Imagery Direction

> TBD — Directional candidates:
> - **Do:** Real animals (pets in lifestyle/natural settings), warm lighting, Italian context where possible.
> - **Don't:** Stock imagery of isolated products on white backgrounds. Generic "pet brand" template imagery.
> - Validate after category lock with competitor imagery audit.

## Voice & Tone

### Writing Style

- **Formality:** TBD — likely conversational, not clinical. Warm but practical.
- **Italian localization:** Primary market is Italy. Italian copy should feel native.
- **Length:** Short sentences; pet owners scanning product pages are action-oriented.

### Key Phrases

> TBD — Validate after category lock with customer/community inputs.

### Words to Avoid

> TBD — Validate after category lock. Initial generic candidates:
> - Overpromising safety/health claims without evidence
> - Jargon specific to a non-selected category (e.g., "dermatologically tested" if not relevant to chosen product)

## Signature Patterns

> TBD — No application has been built yet. Patterns will be added as `/lp-design-spec` identifies them.

_First pattern to define when app is built: product safety/quality signal component (what makes this product trustworthy for an Italian pet owner)._

## App Coverage

| App | Theme | Status | Notes |
|-----|-------|--------|-------|
| _(none yet)_ | _(not created)_ | Not created | No app exists for Pet Product; delivery is currently pre-website direct sales |

> **Prerequisite for Active:** category must be locked, app must be built, theme package must be created, and Token-Source must be a real file path.
