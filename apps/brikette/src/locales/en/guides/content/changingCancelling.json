The cancellation period begins when the hostel receives your email and ends at 00:01 on your scheduled check-in date. Your booking remains active until you receive email confirmation that the cancellation has been processed. A separate Cancellation Administration Fee—usually 15% of the booking price excluding third-party commissions—will be charged. The hostel may cancel your booking without a written request if you fail to check in before reception closes on arrival day, depart early without proper notification, or violate hostel policies. If you do not provide sufficient notice, you will incur charges equivalent to a No-Show."

Email your change request to our official email address within the required notice period. You will receive an email once the change is approved. All changes are subject to room availability and other conditions. If you shorten or extend your stay, the adjustment will be handled as a cancellation or extension request, and any extension is treated as a new reservation. If you leave before your confirmed departure date without receiving an official cancellation confirmation, the original booking terms will remain in effect."
