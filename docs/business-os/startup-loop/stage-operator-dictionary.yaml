# Startup Loop Stage Operator Dictionary
# Canonical naming source for operator-facing stage labels, aliases, and display fields.
# Generated views (stage-operator-map.json, stage-operator-table.md) are derived from this file.
#
# INVARIANTS:
#   - List order must match stages array order in loop-spec.yaml exactly (VC-03).
#   - Aliases must be globally unique across all entries (VC-02).
#   - label_operator_short must be <=28 characters.
#   - Validated against: stage-operator-dictionary.schema.json
#
# Decision reference: docs/plans/startup-loop-marketing-sales-capability-gap-audit/plan.md (TASK-14)
# TASK-02 decision: S6B retains stage key; split into GATE-S6B-STRAT-01 and GATE-S6B-ACT-01.
