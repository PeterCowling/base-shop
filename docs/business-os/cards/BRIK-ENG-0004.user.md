# Experiences Page Intro & Guides Section Refactor

## Summary

Refactor the Experiences page (`/en/experiences`) to:

1. **Rewrite the intro copy** — Lead with utility, cut atmospheric preamble, deliver the point in 40-70 words
2. **Redesign the guides section** — Group guides by experience type with visual headers (title + image)

The goal is to immediately communicate what visitors get (curated itineraries, local picks) and motivate scrolling into the guides section.
