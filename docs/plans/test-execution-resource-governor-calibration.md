# Test Execution Resource Governor Calibration

## Scope

This document stores calibration evidence for the test execution resource governor.

Calibration evidence is split into two tracks:

- Day-zero synthetic baseline generated by `scripts/tests/run-governed-calibration.sh`.
- Multi-day organic soak evidence gathered during normal governed test usage.

Synthetic baseline sections are explicitly tagged as synthetic evidence and should not be treated as full production calibration on their own.

## Day-Zero Synthetic Calibration Baseline

> Evidence tag: synthetic-day-zero (governed harness)

- Label: `synthetic-day-zero`
- Generated-at (latest governed event): `2026-02-13T21:58:44Z`
- Source events file: `.cache/test-governor/events.jsonl`
- Governed events considered: **34**
- Ungoverned events excluded: **0**

### Class Distribution

| Class | Samples | Contention | Avg Workers | P95 queued ms | Max queued ms | Non-zero exits |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| governed-changed | 8 | 1 | 2 | 1000 | 1000 | 0 |
| governed-jest | 18 | 7 | 2 | 1000 | 1000 | 0 |
| governed-turbo | 8 | 1 | 2 | 1000 | 1000 | 0 |

### Queue Metrics
