Early morning ferries (around 09:00–10:00) are popular with day-trippers, while mid-afternoon departures (14:00–16:00) tend to be quieter.",
        "**Weather impact:** The Positano–Capri route crosses open water and can be rough when the wind picks up. Autumn and winter sailings (October–March) are most affected. From the hostel, we've seen cancellations happen with as little as 90 minutes notice when conditions deteriorate.",
        "**Sea conditions:** If you're prone to seasickness, take medication 30–60 minutes before boarding. The crossing is usually calm in early morning and evening; midday seas can be choppier, especially in summer when afternoon thermal winds develop.",
        "**Planning tip:** If you're visiting Capri as a day trip from Positano and have a tight schedule (flights, onward trains, etc.), book a morning outbound ferry and aim to return by 16:00–17:00. This gives you buffer time if the last few ferries are cancelled."

        "**Views:** On clear days, you'll see the entire Positano coastline, Praiano's fjord, and the dramatic cliffs approaching Capri. Sit on the right side (starboard) when departing Positano for the best coastal views."

In high season (June–September), funicular queues can be 30–45 minutes long between 10:00–14:00. Alternatively, taxis charge around €15–20 for the same journey and buses run regularly for €2.",
        "**Return tickets:** If you're doing a day trip, buy your return ferry ticket soon after arriving in Capri (either at the port or online). Popular return times (16:00–18:00) sell out quickly in summer, and you don't want to be stuck hunting for last-minute availability.",

If you're prone to seasickness, bring medication and avoid sitting at the very back of the boat where motion is strongest.",
        "**Cash and cards:** Most ferry operators accept card payments at the ticket booths, but it's wise to carry €50–100 in cash as backup. Capri is more expensive than Positano; expect to pay €8–12 for a simple lunch and €4–6 for a coffee in the Piazzetta.",
        "**Photography:** For the best photos, sit on the right side (starboard) when leaving Positano and the left side (port) when returning. The early morning and late afternoon light is best for coastal shots.",

      "question": "Is the walk to the port difficult?",
      "answer": "The walk from the hostel to Positano port is 15–20 minutes downhill, mostly on stairs. It's straightforward going down, but the return journey uphill is steep and can be tiring, especially in summer heat. If returning with shopping bags or luggage, we suggest taking a taxi from the port back to the hostel (around €10–15, or ask the hostel to arrange pickup)."

      "question": "How much time should I spend in Capri?",

        "Popular day-trip itinerary: Depart Positano around 09:30–10:00, explore Capri 11:00–16:00, return ferry around 17:00–18:00. This avoids the worst crowds and gives you flexibility if return ferries are delayed.",
        "If you want to visit the Blue Grotto, Anacapri, or Villa Jovis, consider staying overnight in Capri (budget hotels near Marina Grande start around €80–100 in low season)."
