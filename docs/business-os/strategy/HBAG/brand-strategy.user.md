## B) Audience

**Primary:** Women ~27–42, fashion-aware, who own one or more bags at LV/Gucci entry tier (€600–€1,500+). They want personal expression through bag accessories — something that reads as genuinely crafted, not mass-produced. Quality that "reads real" in hand and in photos. They deliberate 3–7 days before purchasing at €80–€150; this is a considered purchase, not an impulse buy.

**Secondary:** Gift buyers purchasing for women who fit the primary profile — birthdays, Christmas, milestone self-treats. Packaging and brand story do significant work in this use case.

**Device:** Mobile-first — social discovery via TikTok/Instagram is the primary inbound path.

**Context:** TikTok/Instagram scroll → trend exposure → Etsy search or direct website visit. Mindset at discovery: actively looking for something distinctive for their bag; aesthetic + craft quality are the purchase triggers. At €80–€150, the buyer wants to feel the price is justified by visible craft — not just brand name.

## C) Personality

- **Sophisticated**, not showy
- **Curated**, not cluttered
- **Feminine**, not generic
- **Confident**, not apologetic — own the quality story; don't over-justify the price
- **Tasteful**, not trend-chasing — the bag charm trend is an entry point, not the identity

## D) Voice & Tone

### Writing Style

- **Formality:** Conversational — not corporate, not overly casual
- **Sentence length:** Short to medium — punchy product copy; slightly longer for craft/story context
- **Humour:** None to light and dry — premium positioning; warmth over wit
- **Technical level:** Some detail expected — dimensions, material composition, and compatibility matter to this buyer; state them clearly without making copy feel like a spec sheet

### Key Phrases

Three core lines used in a consistent stack. Use one per asset; use all three for hero layouts.

| Line | Use when | What it signals |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| **Made to be shown.** | Visibility, display — accessory belongs on the bag, not in a drawer | Quality that reads at distance, not just up close; designed to be seen |
| **Considered detail.** | Positioning against charm pile-on | Curated restraint; single-piece purchase is the right choice |
| **Use every day.** | Daily use, versatility, value justification | Not a trend buy; justifies €80–€150 as a keeper piece |

**Approved variants:**

*Made to be shown.*
- "Made to be noticed — quietly."
- "A visible detail, finished to be kept."
- "Made to be seen, finished to last."
- Pairing line: "Cut clean. Finished by hand."

*Considered detail.*
- "One piece, chosen well."
- "Edited, not overdone."
- "One clean finishing touch."
- Pairing line: "Styled once. Worn often."

*Use every day.*
- "Finished to last."
- "Works across your classics."
- "From day bag to evening bag." *(only if shown visually)*
- Pairing line: "Easy on. Stays put."

**Usage rules:**
- One core line per asset (caption, PDP section, packaging card) unless using the full 3-line hero stack
- Never add hype language ("statement", "must-have", "turn heads")
- Always anchor at least one line in something tangible: hardware, finish, stitching, how it clips
- Do not use "fits all handbags" — anchor compatibility to hardware specifics instead

**Ready-to-use copy:**

*PDP hero (short):*
> Made to be shown.
> A refined finishing touch that clips on in seconds.

*PDP section header + subcopy:*
> Considered detail.
> Structured, finished, and made to be worn often — not piled on.

*Instagram caption:*
> Use every day.
> Clips on fast, holds securely, finished for a crisp look up close.

*Packaging insert (micro):*
> Made to be shown.
> Thank you for choosing one considered piece — use it every day.

### Words to Avoid

- "Luxury" / "premium" / "exclusive" — empty fashion filler without substantiation; show craft instead
- "Fits all handbags" — unverified compatibility claim; be specific about attachment hardware
- "Birkin" — IP/trade dress risk; do not use in any public-facing copy (2025 Paris Judicial Court ruling)

## E) Positioning Constraints

**Imagery prominence:** high
**Typical imagery character:** Bright, colourful product accessories (charms, holders) photographed against editorial neutral backgrounds. Product colour range will be wide and varied — the site chrome must recede completely and never compete.

**Origin claim:** Designed in Italy
> Manufacturing: China-based supplier (confirmed ASSESSMENT-08). Pete designs and curates from Positano, Italy. "Made in Italy" cannot be claimed under Italian Law 166/2009 and EU consumer law. "Designed in Italy" is accurate and legally defensible.

### Aesthetic Constraints

**Visual identity (brand + site + Etsy)**
- No loud brand marks — no oversized logos, no monograms, no designer-parody cues
- One accent metal only — gold or light gold; consistent across hardware and photography props
- Palette discipline — neutrals first (ivory, warm grey, espresso, black) with one seasonal colour lane at a time; avoid rainbow grids
- Typography — one elegant serif + one clean sans; no script fonts (read "generic Etsy" immediately)
- Whitespace is the brand — generous spacing, short lines, minimal badges; no "sale" stickers unless intentionally breaking premium posture

**Product presentation (photo/video)**
- Lighting: soft directional daylight look; avoid high-saturation craft-fair lighting or harsh flash
- Backgrounds: stone, matte plaster, dark wood, neutral textiles; avoid glitter vinyl, patterned backdrops, flat-lay chaos
- Hands: manicured, neutral nails, minimal jewellery; hands should imply taste, not influencer-haul
- Scale: always include one clean scale reference (hand, bag strap, AirPods) — editorial, not measurement-photo spam
- Proof of craft: one macro shot per listing (stitching/edge/hardware); no workbench-mess authenticity theatre

**Packaging**
- No overly cute — avoid pastel tissue + confetti + cartoon thank-you cards
- Materials must feel real — textured card, minimal foil, fabric pouch optional; keep colour neutral
- Insert card voice: short, calm, specific (material + care + how to clip); no gushy paragraphs

**Social/content (TikTok/IG)**
- Avoid trend-chasing templates unless kept restrained — no loud text overlays, no meme-audio dependence
- Four content pillars only: (1) styling in-the-wild, (2) clip-on in seconds function demo, (3) craft close-ups, (4) gift/unbox ritual
- No hard selling — fewer CTAs, more "here's how it wears"

### Brand Inspirations ("like X but not Y")

| Reference | Borrow | Avoid |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Polène** | Material-first storytelling, calm product focus, tight palettes, clean PDP photography, form-led design narrative | Feeling cold or distant — Caryina should be warmer and more "personal accessory" |
| **DeMellier** | Accessible aspiration, composed visuals, confident copy, giftability | Any "status ladder" language — stay craft-led, not social-proof-led |
| **Strathberry** | Hardware as a quiet design signature — treating the detail that matters | Making hardware the whole identity — Caryina is "edited detail", not "signature gimmick" |
| **Cuyana** | "Fewer, better" framing, repeat-wear language, understated confidence | Utilitarian dryness — Caryina needs more femininity and ornament-as-jewellery |
| **Mejuri** | "Daily piece" language, approachable refinement, everyday jewellery positioning | Influencer-haul energy — keep it composed and curated |
| **Monica Vinader** | Gifting cues, clean product close-ups, personalisation vibe | Over-personalisation or charm overload |
| **Aesop** | Quiet confidence, sensory language, disciplined visuals, premium-through-detail without saying it | Becoming too austere — Caryina should still feel feminine and fashion-adjacent |
| **The Row** *(reference, not template)* | Restraint, "one perfect detail", zero noise | Emotional flatness — Caryina should feel inviting, not severe |
