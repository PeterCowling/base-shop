    "Arienzo sits just east of Positano with long afternoon sun, turquoise water, and a dramatic stairway down from the Amalfi Coast road. It is the liveliest lido within easy reach of Hostel Brikette, but between the stairs and reservation-only policies you want a plan before you set off.",
    "Use this guide to lock in your spot, choose whether to ride the shuttle boat or walk the 300 steps, and budget for lunch, drinks, and the ride home."

        "Arienzo is the closest full-service beach club outside the crush of Spiaggia Grande. The cliffside terraces catch sunlight until early evening, the water stays clear for swimming, and the bar keeps the party atmosphere without tipping into nightlife territory.",
        "You can split your group between packages that include loungers and lunch or reserve a front-row deck for a splurge day. With some planning you dodge queues and still be back at the hostel before sunset drinks on the terrace."

        "The easiest route is the Arienzo Beach Club shuttle boat that departs from Spiaggia Grande. Boats run roughly every 30 minutes from 09:30, with the last outbound ride around 13:30. Your reservation confirmation includes a QR code—show it on the dock and keep the return schedule handy.",
        "Walking is possible if you prefer to avoid the boat. Take the SITA bus towards Amalfi (board at the Sponda stop 10 minutes downhill from the hostel) and hop off at the signed Arienzo stop. From there descend 300 stairs through lemon terraces to reach the club entrance.",
        "Arriving by car or scooter is discouraged; parking is extremely limited and traffic police fine vehicles that block the bends."

        "Sun reaches the first two rows until roughly 17:30 in summer before the cliffs cast shade. Ask staff to angle umbrellas as the light shifts, especially if you prefer a full day of tanning.",
        "Freshwater showers, lockers, and changing cabins are included with the day packages. Wi-Fi is patchy; download playlists or ferry updates before you arrive."
