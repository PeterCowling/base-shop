    "body": "Travel from Positano to central Naples entirely by sea. This route starts with a walk down from your accommodation to Positano's ferry pier at Spiaggia Grande, then a scenic 70-90 minute ferry crossing to Naples, and a final short transfer from the port to Napoli Centrale station. Best for: travelers who want to avoid the winding coastal road and enjoy sea views. Not ideal for: winter visits (limited service November-March), anyone uncomfortable going down steep stairs (200+ steps to the pier), or those on very tight schedules (ferry cancellations happen frequently). Total journey time is typically 2-3.5 hours door-to-door, including the walk to the port and the port-to-station transfer in Naples. Expect to pay €18-25 for the ferry plus €1-2 for the tram or €10-15 for a taxi in Naples. This guide covers walking from the upper village to Positano's port, buying ferry tickets, boarding, the crossing, and arrival at Naples with onward connections."

      "body": "The Positano to Naples ferry route operates seasonally, with the most frequent service running April through October. During peak summer months (June-September), you'll typically find 3-6 departures per day, while shoulder season (April, May, October) usually offers 1-3 daily sailings. Winter service (November-March) is extremely limited or non-existent.\n\n**Typical timeline:**\n- Walk from upper village (Chiesa Nuova/Montepertuso) down to the port: 20-30 minutes\n- Walk from central Positano to the port: 10-15 minutes\n- Arrive at port and purchase tickets: 15-20 minutes before departure\n- Ferry crossing: 70-90 minutes (hydrofoils are faster, traditional ferries slower)\n- Disembark in Naples and transfer to Napoli Centrale: 15-25 minutes by tram, 10-15 minutes by taxi\n- Total door-to-door from upper village: 2.5-3.5 hours\n- Total from central Positano: 2-3 hours\n\n**Who this route is good for:** Travelers departing Positano who want a scenic, direct route to Naples without dealing with crowded buses. Ideal if you enjoy being on the water and are comfortable with the steep downhill walk to the port (much easier than climbing up!).\n\n**Who should consider alternatives:** Anyone traveling in winter, those uncomfortable with stairs (even going down, 200+ steps can be challenging with luggage), travelers on a very tight schedule (ferry delays and cancellations are common), or anyone prone to seasickness. The %HOWTO:positano-sorrento-bus|bus via Sorrento% runs year-round and costs less.\n\n**Weather and cancellations:** Ferry services are weather-dependent. Even in summer, rough seas or strong winds can lead to last-minute cancellations, usually announced the morning of departure. Always check with your ferry operator before walking down to the port. If ferries are cancelled, you'll need to walk back up and take the bus route instead. From our experience, cancellations are most common in late autumn (October-November) and early spring (March-April) when sudden weather changes are frequent. If the forecast shows wind speeds above 25-30 knots or significant wave heights, expect a high likelihood of cancellation. Call the ferry company or check their website the night before and again on the morning of your departure."

      "body": "The gallery below shows the walk from the upper village down to Positano's port. The route follows Via Cristoforo Colombo (the main coastal road) downhill, then descends the long staircase to Spiaggia Grande beach and the ferry pier. Look for signage pointing to \"Spiaggia\" or \"Marina\" as you descend. The stairs are steep but well-maintained, with handrails. On a hot day, the walk down can still be tiring with luggage, so pace yourself and use the handrails."

      "body": "Positano's ferry pier is located at the bottom of the village on Spiaggia Grande (the main beach). Getting there requires descending 200+ steep steps from the main coastal road.\n\n**From the upper village (Chiesa Nuova or Montepertuso):**\n\nIf you're staying in the upper village, you'll first need to reach the main coastal road (Via Cristoforo Colombo) and the bus stops. From there, you have two options:\n\n1. **Walk down (free, 20-30 minutes total):** Follow Via Cristoforo Colombo downhill toward the center of Positano. As you descend, you'll pass shops, restaurants, and hotels. Look for signs pointing to \"Spiaggia\" or \"Marina Grande.\" Eventually, you'll reach a large staircase (with a ceramic dome at the top) descending toward the beach. This is the main access to the port. The stairs are steep and narrow in places, with about 200-250 steps total. Take your time, use the handrails, and stop to rest as needed. At the bottom, you'll reach the beach promenade and the ferry pier is straight ahead.\n\n2. **Take a local bus partway down (€1.30, saves ~10 minutes):** Catch any SITA bus heading down toward \"Positano centro\" or \"Spiaggia\" and get off at one of the lower stops near the church (Chiesa di Santa Maria Assunta). From there, descend the remaining stairs to the beach.\n\n**From central Positano:**\n\nIf you're staying in central Positano near Via Cristoforo Colombo, head downhill toward the beach, following signs for \"Spiaggia\" or \"Marina.\" The walk takes 10-15 minutes and involves descending the main staircase (200+ steps) to reach the beach level and ferry pier.\n\n**Arriving at the port:**\n\nOnce you reach the beach promenade, the ferry pier is at the far right (east) end of Spiaggia Grande. Look for the small pier structure and ticket kiosks. Arrive at least 15-20 minutes before your departure to purchase or exchange tickets and queue for boarding. In summer, the pier area can be crowded with day-trippers and beachgoers, so allow extra time to navigate through the crowds."

      "title": "Buy tickets and board",
      "body": "Several companies operate ferries and hydrofoils between Positano and Naples. Tickets are generally not interchangeable between operators.\n\n**Main operators:**\n- **Alilauro** (hydrofoils and ferries) — most frequent service\n- **NLG (Navigazione Libera del Golfo)** — traditional ferries, often cheaper\n- **Positano Jet** — small hydrofoils, limited schedule\n\n**Ticket prices:** €18-25 per person one-way, depending on vessel type and season. Larger luggage may incur a small surcharge (€2-5 per bag).\n\n**Where to buy tickets:**\n\n1. **At the port on the day** — Small ticket kiosks are located near the pier. This is the most flexible option (you can check weather conditions first). Arrive 20-30 minutes early as popular departures can sell out in summer.\n\n2. **Online in advance** — Most operators sell tickets on their websites. You'll receive a voucher that must be exchanged for a boarding pass at the port kiosk (add 10-15 minutes for this). Advance booking is recommended for July-August.\n\n**Boarding:**\n- Wait in the queue near the gangway. Staff will check tickets and direct you to luggage storage.\n- On hydrofoils, seating is usually assigned. On larger ferries, it's first-come, first-served.\n- The gangway can be narrow and moves with the swell — watch your step.\n- The ferry will likely make stops at %HOWTO:amalfi-positano-ferry|Amalfi% and %HOWTO:sorrento-positano-ferry|Sorrento% before reaching Naples. Don't disembark early — wait for the Naples announcement.\n\n**During the crossing:**\n- The trip takes 70-90 minutes depending on vessel type and number of stops.\n- The crossing can be choppy in spring and autumn. If you're prone to seasickness, sit outside, focus on the horizon, and consider taking medication before boarding.\n- Facilities are basic: small restrooms, a snack bar or vending machine on larger vessels."

      "body": "Ferries from Positano dock at one of Naples' waterfront terminals, typically **Molo Beverello** or **Calata Porta di Massa**, both located near Piazza Municipio. From here, you need to transfer to Napoli Centrale station (if continuing by train) or your accommodation in central Naples.\n\n**Disembarking:**\n- Wait for the crew to secure the gangway and give the signal to exit.\n- Retrieve your luggage from the storage area.\n- Follow the crowd off the pier and through the terminal area.\n\n**Transfer to Napoli Centrale (central station):**\n\n**Option 1: Tram 1 (cheapest, €1.10)**\nFrom the port area, walk toward the main road and look for the Tram 1 stop (overhead electric lines and tram tracks). Board any Tram 1 heading toward \"Piazza Garibaldi\" or \"Napoli Centrale.\" The ride takes about 15-20 minutes. Validate your ticket in the yellow machine on board. Get off at Garibaldi stop, which is right outside Napoli Centrale station.\n\n**Option 2: Taxi (faster, €10-15)**\nTaxis queue near the port exits. Tell the driver \"Napoli Centrale\" or \"Stazione Centrale.\" The ride takes 10-15 minutes depending on traffic. Confirm the driver starts the meter.\n\n**Option 3: Walk (free, 25-30 minutes)**\nIf you're traveling light and want to see the city, you can walk from the port to Napoli Centrale. Head northeast along the waterfront, then inland toward Piazza Garibaldi. This is only recommended if you're comfortable navigating Naples and don't have heavy luggage.\n\n**Continuing to the airport or other destinations:**\n- **To Naples Airport:** From Napoli Centrale, take the Alibus shuttle (€5, 20-30 minutes). See the %HOWTO:naples-airport-positano-bus|Naples Airport to Positano bus guide% for details (reverse the directions).\n- **To Sorrento, Pompeii, or Herculaneum:** From Napoli Centrale, take the Circumvesuviana train (buy tickets at the lower-level Circumvesuviana station, not the main Trenitalia station).\n- **To Rome or other cities:** Use the main Trenitalia or Italo high-speed trains from Napoli Centrale.\n\n**If you're staying in Naples:**\nThe port area is near many central Naples hotels and attractions. The tram, metro, and buses connect the port to most neighborhoods. Ask your accommodation for specific directions from \"Molo Beverello\" or the ferry terminal."
