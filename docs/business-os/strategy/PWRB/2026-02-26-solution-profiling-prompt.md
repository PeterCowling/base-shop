## Instructions for Researcher

You are a product-type landscape researcher. Your task is to map the range of viable approaches that could solve a specific, named customer problem. You are NOT recommending a product or a business model. You are enumerating distinct product-type options with honest feasibility signals.

**Explicitly do NOT:**
- Score demand or estimate how many people want any option
- Estimate market size
- Rank options or declare any option "best"
- Issue a recommendation or verdict
- Assess whether customers want any of these — that question is out of scope for this research

Feasibility signals only. The decision about which option to pursue comes after this research.

Produce 5–10 distinct product-type approaches. Options must differ in product category or delivery model — not just in feature set. Treat each option independently.

## Problem Context

*(Reproduced verbatim from `docs/business-os/strategy/PWRB/2026-02-26-problem-statement.user.md` — do not reframe.)*

### Core Problem

Tourists exploring the Amalfi Coast rely entirely on their smartphones for navigation, photography, real-time transport (SITA buses, ferries), and staying in contact with travel companions. Exploration days routinely run 6–10+ hours — hiking trails, ferry hops between towns, long lunch stops, afternoon at a beach club, evening passeggiata — with no predictable, convenient access to phone charging along the route.

They face a forced choice with no comfortable middle option:

- **Carry a personal powerbank** — which is practical if they remembered to pack one, charge it the night before, and are willing to carry weight all day. For air travellers (the majority of Amalfi Coast visitors), a powerbank they buy for the trip is an item to manage on the flight home. For those arriving without one, buying a cheap €15–€20 unit at a local tobacconist or Chinese goods shop solves the immediate charge but adds kit they'll throw away or struggle to take back through security.
- **Find a café or charging point** — which requires stopping, spending, and being tethered to a socket while the phone charges. Not possible while walking a coastal path, waiting for a bus, or on a ferry between Positano and Amalfi. Charging infrastructure is concentrated inside hospitality venues; it disappears the moment a tourist leaves the table.

The result: tourists with dead or near-dead phones lose access to navigation, miss photo moments at peak-attraction arrivals, experience mounting anxiety that begins to shape their behaviour (cutting the day short, staying near the hotel, avoiding longer hikes), and occasionally find themselves without the ability to contact companions or call transport in a coastal area with unreliable cellular coverage in places.

### Affected User Groups

1. **International tourists on a 1–5 day visit (primary)** — international visitors staying 1–5 nights in the Amalfi Coast area (Sorrento, Positano, Ravello, Amalfi), typically touring the coast as one stop in a wider Italy itinerary. High daily spend, high photo/navigation dependency. This group typically flies in, making carry-back of a new powerbank a nuisance.

2. **Italian domestic tourists and weekend visitors (secondary)** — Italians and Italian-resident Europeans on 1–3 day breaks, typically arriving by car. The same navigational and photographic dependency; slightly more likely to own a powerbank, but not reliably charged or carried.

3. **Day-trippers arriving by ferry or coach (tertiary)** — day visitors arriving by organised coach tour or high-speed ferry from Naples or Salerno, with 4–8 hours on the coast and no base to return to for mid-day charging.

## Solution Type Landscape

For each of the following product-type approaches (or others you identify), provide the feasibility analysis described in the next section. Start from this seed list but feel free to add or split options if the research reveals meaningful distinctions:

1. **Shared powerbank rental station network** — physical stations installed at tourist venues (hotels, restaurants, cafés, beach clubs); tourists borrow a powerbank via app or card, return it at any station in the network, pay a daily rental fee. Deposit or pre-authorisation holds guard against non-return.

2. **Vending machine powerbanks (buy-to-keep, low price)** — vending-machine-style dispensers at tourist hotspots selling low-cost (~€10–15) branded disposable or keep-it powerbanks. No return required. Tourist takes the unit and keeps it.

3. **Venue lending programme (hotel/reception model)** — hotels and guesthouses lend powerbanks to guests from a pooled inventory at check-in. Managed by front desk. Deposit taken on a copy of the credit card hold at check-in, returned on check-out. No multi-venue return network needed; scoped to one property or small group.

4. **Fixed mains charging lockers / smart lockers** — phone lockers at tourist hotspots (viewpoints, ferry terminals, town squares) where the tourist locks their phone in a secure charging cabinet, goes exploring for 30–90 minutes, returns to a charged phone. No device leaves the premises.

5. **Wireless charging furniture / embedded charging pads at hospitality venues** — Qi-capable charging pads built into café tables, restaurant countertops, and hotel lobbies. Tourist places phone on the pad while eating/drinking. No hardware loan, no deposit, no return network.

6. **Solar-powered public charging kiosks** — fixed public kiosks powered by solar panels at tourist viewpoints, public squares, and ferry landing areas. Tourist plugs in, waits, charges phone. No rental; free or coin-operated.

7. **Compact single-use/recyclable emergency powerbank (retail product)** — purpose-designed lightweight recyclable or take-back-scheme powerbank unit sold in tourist retail (souvenir shops, pharmacy, tabaccherie). Branded, local-story product. Single-use capacity (~5,000mAh, 1 phone charge). Sold, not rented.

8. **Tourist-facing charging concierge app + network of venue charging points** — an app/platform listing all participating venues (cafés, hotels, shops) where tourists can access a socket or USB port in exchange for a small fee (~€1). Venue-side: a small branded USB hub installed by the platform operator. Consumer-side: in-app map and pay-to-charge QR code.

9. **Subscription / tourist-pass charging service** — tourist buys a 1-day or 3-day "charge pass" at a hotel or tourism office that entitles them to unlimited use of charging points (sockets or powerbank borrows) at participating venues. Treated like a transportation card. Venues enrolled as access points.

10. **Peer-to-peer or crowd-charged network** — platform that allows tourists and locals to rent their personal powerbanks (or spare capacity) to other tourists. Analogous to Airbnb for charging. No central hardware fleet; relies on participant density.

## Per-Option Feasibility Analysis

For each of the 10 options above, research and report on the following four criteria:

**A. Launch feasibility for a small team**
- Can this be launched by a team of 1–3 people within 6 months?
- What are the minimum capital requirements to reach first paying customer?
- What is the minimum viable footprint (e.g., how many venues / units / locations) needed for the product to be useful to a tourist?

**B. Distribution channels**
- Are there proven channels for getting this type of product/service in front of tourists on arrival?
- Does the product require tourists to discover it before they arrive, or can it be discovered on the ground?
- Are hotels, restaurants, or tourism offices natural distribution partners for this option, or does it require its own standalone channel?

**C. Operational and capital constraints**
- What are the hardest operational problems this option creates? (e.g., hardware maintenance, inventory balancing, theft/loss, technical infrastructure)
- What capital is at risk if usage is lower than expected?
- Are there operational analogues in other tourist destinations that have succeeded or failed?

**D. Evidence of adjacent businesses**
- Name 2–3 real businesses (global or regional) operating in this product-type category or adjacent to it. Provide their geography, scale (approximate), and any publicly known outcomes.
- Has this model been tried in European tourist destinations specifically? If so, what happened?

## Regulatory and Compliance Flags

For each option, flag any known regulatory, certification, or compliance requirements. If unknown, state "unknown — research gap" rather than omitting.

Areas to consider per option:
- **Electrical safety and product certification** (CE marking for charging hardware, UL for US-bound, relevant EU Low Voltage Directive)
- **Payment services regulation** (if taking deposits or operating a stored-value system — PSD2 in EU, e-money licensing thresholds)
- **Consumer protection** (distance-selling rules for deposits, refund obligation timelines, language requirements for terms in Italy)
- **Tourism and commercial licensing** (requirements to operate commercial equipment in a municipality, concession requirements for public kiosks in Italian comuni)
- **Data protection** (GDPR implications if collecting location data or device identifiers as part of the rental/return flow)
- **Waste and recycling** (for options involving disposable or single-use units — Italian battery disposal law, RAEE directive)
- **Liability and insurance** (for options where tourist's device is in operator custody — locker model, charging concierge)

---

## Manufacturing and Supply Chain Flags

For options involving physical hardware (Stations 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7):

- **Typical MOQ ranges** — what is the minimum order quantity from a credible manufacturer for each hardware type? Is there a white-label / OEM market?
- **Lead times** — typical ex-factory lead time from a Chinese manufacturer; time to first delivery including customs clearance into Italy
- **Supplier geography** — which countries produce this hardware type; are there EU-based manufacturers for any option?
- **White-label availability** — can this hardware be purchased unbranded and custom-labelled, or does it require a licence or franchise relationship with an incumbent platform operator?
- **Maintenance and spare parts** — for station-based models, what is the typical maintenance cycle and spare parts dependency? What can go wrong in an outdoor coastal climate (heat, humidity, salt air)?

For options involving software infrastructure (Stations 8, 9, 10):
- **Infrastructure dependencies** — what cloud, payment, and connectivity services are required? Are there viable white-label or SaaS platforms in this category (e.g., existing shared-powerbank SaaS operators who license their platform)?
