You are a product strategy researcher for a DTC lifestyle brand. Your job is to use web research (with citations) to identify and evaluate adjacent products that can be sold alongside a soft retention headband for external cochlear implant (CI) sound processors, in order to build a fuller product range.

OUTPUT RULES
- Use web research and cite sources for all factual statements (competitor offerings, manufacturer accessory catalogues, typical price points, materials, regulatory definitions).
- Separate clearly: (a) what you checked (with source + date), (b) what you inferred, (c) what remains unknown without supplier quotes, lab testing, or legal counsel.
- Do NOT make medical efficacy claims. Do NOT propose products whose core promise is to improve hearing outcomes.
- Do NOT output a generic brainstorm list. Provide a structured range strategy with evidence and prioritisation.

DATE / LOCALE
- Today: 20 Feb 2026 (Europe/Rome)
- Launch market: Italy first, then EU + US
- Currency focus: EUR (include USD notes if relevant)

BUSINESS CONTEXT (PRODUCT + POSITIONING)
- Current product: soft headband worn on the head to keep EXTERNAL CI sound processors secure during daily life (school, play, sport, sleep, everyday activity).
- Positioning: comfort / retention / aesthetics; lifestyle accessory for existing CI users; no medical device claims.
- Primary customers: parents/caregivers of young children (~6 months+). Secondary: active CI users; adult daily-comfort users.
- Price range today: EUR 12–32 (core tier EUR 18–32).
- Emotional territory: reassuring (not clinical), practical, approachable, inclusive/normalising (NOT concealment), warm.

REGULATORY / CLAIM-DRIFT GUARDRAILS (EU MDR — BE PRECISE)
- Cite EU MDR passages relevant to: "intended purpose" and "accessory for a medical device".
- Do NOT claim classification is determined by "vibes". Instead: flag products or messaging that risk implying the accessory is necessary for the implant to function medically (e.g., "restore hearing", "improve hearing", "therapy", "treatment", "essential for hearing to work").
- Keep benefits framed as: comfort, secure wear, reduced drops/loss, everyday usability, convenience, organisation, personalisation.
- For each adjacent product category, include a "claim drift risk" note: low/medium/high with rationale.

SCOPE: WHAT "ADJACENT PRODUCTS" MEANS HERE
Adjacent products should:
- Be used with (or around) the external processor / wearing routine / daily life of CI users and families.
- Expand basket size and repeat purchases (sizes, colours, seasonal drops, replacements, add-ons).
- Be feasible as a small DTC brand (manufacturing, compliance, shipping, returns).
- Be extensible into a coherent range architecture (not one-off oddities).

RESEARCH TRACKS + REQUIRED OUTPUTS

TRACK 1 — CUSTOMER JOBS & MOMENTS (EVIDENCE-LED)
Map the user journey for parents and adult CI users around:
- morning routine / school / play / sport
- sleep / bedtime
- travel / beach / rain / sweat
- storage, organisation, cleaning, and "where did it go?"
Identify the top 10 recurring problems ("jobs to be done") that adjacent products could solve.
Support with citations from community discussions, manufacturer guidance, or reputable hearing/CI resources (avoid doxxing; use public sources).

TRACK 2 — COMPETITOR + MANUFACTURER ACCESSORY LANDSCAPE
Build a structured map of:
A) independent accessory brands selling to CI/hearing-device wearers
B) manufacturer "official accessory" catalogues (e.g., retention/fixation, clips, covers, cases, drying/cleaning, sports solutions)
For each, capture:
- product types
- naming/positioning style (functional vs lifestyle)
- typical price bands (cite)
- notable gaps/opportunities
Cite primary sources (brand sites, manufacturer catalogues, authorised retailers).

TRACK 3 — ADJACENT PRODUCT CANDIDATE SET (RANGE BLUEPRINT)
Generate 12–20 adjacent product concepts grouped into a range architecture, such as:
- Core extensions (variants, sizes, seasonal colours, premium fabrics)
- Add-ons (decorative/identity without "concealment" messaging)
- Retention ecosystem (non-invasive, non-medical accessories that complement the headband)
- Storage/organisation (cases, pouches, travel kits)
- Care/maintenance (non-medical cleaning/organisation items; be careful with any "drying" or electronics-related claims)
- Parent convenience (multi-pack bundles, school spares, label systems)
For each concept, provide a one-page style card with:
- What it is (plain description)
- Primary customer + use moment
- Value proposition (non-medical framing)
- Expected ASP range (EUR) and why (with citations where possible)
- Suggested materials / form factor (and why)
- Size/fit complexity (low/med/high)
- Manufacturing complexity (low/med/high)
- Returns risk (low/med/high)
- Compliance/claim-drift risk (low/med/high)
- Competitive references (who sells something similar; cite)
- "Range role" (entry add-on / premium / replenishment / bundle anchor)

TRACK 4 — PRIORITISATION + MVP ROADMAP
Create a prioritised shortlist:
- Top 5 adjacent products to explore next
- Top 3 to build first (90-day plan)
Rank using a scoring rubric (show weights), e.g.:
- Customer impact (30%)
- Differentiation / whitespace (20%)
- Manufacturability + supply chain simplicity (20%)
- Margin potential at EUR 18–45 ASP (15%)
- Claim-drift/compliance risk (15%)
Provide:
- 90-day MVP plan for top 3: prototyping approach, sampling, minimum viable variants (SKUs), basic QA, photography needs, and launch bundle strategy.
- 12-month range roadmap: how the catalogue expands without becoming incoherent.

TRACK 5 — BUNDLING, PRICING, AND MERCHANDISING STRATEGY
Propose:
- Bundle archetypes (starter kit, school kit, sport kit, sleep kit, travel kit)
- Cross-sell logic on PDP and cart
- Replenishment / replacement triggers (kids grow, lost items, wear-and-tear)
Keep price points realistic for Italy/EU and consistent with the EUR 12–32 base product.

TRACK 6 — BRAND/COMMUNITY SENSITIVITY CHECK
For each adjacent category, flag:
- any risk of "concealment" framing (avoid)
- any risk of disability-identity misstep (avoid unless validated)
- language guidelines for marketing copy (do/don't examples)

DELIVERABLE FORMAT
Write as a research document (en-GB) with:
1) Executive summary (range thesis + top opportunities)
2) Jobs-to-be-done map (top 10 problems + evidence)
3) Competitive/manufacturer accessory landscape (structured table + citations)
4) Range blueprint (12–20 product cards; grouped by range role)
5) Prioritised shortlist + scoring table
6) 90-day MVP plan (top 3)
7) 12-month range roadmap + bundling strategy
8) Risk register (claim drift/compliance + operational risks)

REMINDERS
- No medical claims; avoid implying improved hearing.
- Cite everything factual.
- Clearly separate checked vs inferred vs unknown.
- Use Italy-first lens (language accessibility, pricing expectations, channels).
