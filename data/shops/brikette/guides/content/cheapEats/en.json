    "Positano doesn't have to drain your travel budget. By mixing takeaway classics, supermarket picnics, and smart sit-down choices, you can eat well for €15–25 per day while other travelers spend triple that on waterfront tables.",
    "From the hostel, we've watched guests master the art of eating cheap: they grab morning pastries from Collina Bakery (5 minutes uphill), stock the terrace fridge with minimarket picnics, and save sit-down meals for special occasions. Here's exactly how to do it."

        "Shop at minimarkets uphill (Via dei Mulini, Via Cristoforo Colombo) where prices are 20–30% lower than beachfront kiosks. A 1.5L water bottle costs €0.80 vs €3 on the sand. We've seen the difference add up: guests who shop uphill save €50–70 over a week.",
        "Eat your main meal at lunch when many trattorias offer \\\\\"menu del giorno\\\\\" (€12–18 for pasta, water, coffee) instead of dinner à la carte (€25–40 per person). Staff at uphill spots are used to budget travelers and won't rush you.",
        "Refill water bottles at the hostel or the public fountain near %LINK:chiesaNuovaArrivals|Chiesa Nuova%—carrying 750ml+ saves €2–4 daily. The hostel has filtered water available 24/7; just bring your own bottle or borrow one from the common area.",
        "Use the hostel terrace as your dining room: breakfast pastries at 8am with sunrise views, picnic lunches spread out on the tables, and sunset aperitivo with minimarket wine. It's social, scenic, and saves a fortune on restaurant covers."

        "Panini & focaccia: €4–6 at delis and bakeries. Ask for caprese (mozzarella, tomato, basil), prosciutto, or eggplant parm. Specify \\\\\"senza\\\\\" if you're avoiding ingredients. From the hostel, Collina Bakery is a 5-minute uphill walk; get there by 10am for the full panini menu.",

        "Takeaway salads & pasta: €5–8 from deli counters. Great for picnics or eating back at the hostel terrace with a view. Ask for extra napkins and cutlery, or use the reusable set available in the hostel kitchen."
