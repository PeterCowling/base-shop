        "3. Take the staircase on your left, follow it uphill as it curves to the right, and climb to the top.",
        "4. Turn right at the top, then immediately take the next staircase heading uphill to reach map point 4.",
        "5. From point 4, turn left onto the road, walk about 10 metres (30 feet), cross over, and take the staircase directly in front of you.",
        "6. Follow the stairs until they meet another road. If you look back, the scene should match the point 3 photo. Cross straight ahead onto the next staircase and keep climbing.",
        "7. When the stairs finish, walk onto the road ahead, turn left, and continue uphill for just over 100 metres (330 feet).",
        "8. Turn right onto the familiar staircase that leads straight back to Hostel Brikette’s main door."
