  "intro": [
    "Laurito is a pocket-sized cove tucked between Positano and Praiano. Two beach clubs — Da Adolfo and Villa Tre Ville — dominate the shoreline, leaving just a sliver of public sand. The reward is west-facing sunshine, iconic lunch spots, and a quieter atmosphere than Spiaggia Grande.",
    "Use this guide to decide which club suits your style, understand how the water taxis operate, and map out the bus-and-stairs route back to Hostel Brikette."

        "Laurito sits just outside Positano’s centre, so crowds thin out compared with Spiaggia Grande. Sun hits the deck until early evening, the water stays calm for swimming, and the cliff backdrop makes for classic Amalfi Coast photos.",
        "You will need either a confirmed reservation or patience for the tiny free strip, but once you are settled it is one of the most relaxed spots within a short ride of Hostel Brikette."

        "Reservations run through the hotel concierge. Seats can exceed €200 for two in high season, but include towels, showers, and return boat service to Spiaggia Grande.",
        "Late afternoon is particularly scenic; staff often arrange sunset spritz tastings before the final shuttle back to Positano."
