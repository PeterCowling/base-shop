# HEAD — Naming Candidates Round 7

## §4.0 Collapse Test Results

**Test 1 — Probe generation (3 names per territory, 15 total):**

| Territory | Probe 1 | Probe 2 | Probe 3 |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| T1 Hair Secure | Duranta | Tenistra | Worriva |
| T2 Organised Safe | Stivanda | Riposta | Tracinda |
| T3 Part of You | Wornuala | Abituanda | Tuovana |
| T4 Worn Out Loud | Mostranda | Brillanda | Sfogvira |
| T5 Easy Hair System | Facilanda | Sempvora | Sublesta |

**Test 2 — Swap test result:** PASS. "Duranta" (endures/lasts) cannot be read as organising, belonging, displaying, or ease — the dur- root exclusively maps to retention. "Stivanda" (stowed/packed) cannot be read as retention, belonging, display, or ease — stiv- root is container/EDC territory only. "Wornuala" (worn-as-habit/self) cannot be read as retention, organising, display, or ease — the worn+abitual composite is strictly identity territory. "Mostranda" (shows/displays) cannot be read as retention, organising, belonging, or ease — mostr- root locks it to public display. "Facilanda" (easy/effortless) cannot be read as retention, organising, belonging, or display — facil- root is system-simplicity territory only. All five territories remain semantically distinct.

**Test 3 — Brand test result:** PASS. T1 reads as a premium retention accessories brand (athletic-wear reliability register). T2 reads as an EDC/everyday-carry organiser brand (Bellroy/Peak Design register). T3 reads as an everyday personal accessories brand (habitual identity, unremarkably worn). T4 reads as a visible, styled accessories brand (confident, public-facing, patch and headband display). T5 reads as a child-managed kit brand (no-fuss, self-run, done-in-seconds). All five are clearly different competing brands with different vocabularies.

**Gate result: ALL THREE TESTS PASS — proceeding to full generation.**

## Summary

**Territory distribution:** T1 Hair Secure: 58 names (patterns A: 14, B: 13, C: 6, E: 25); T2 Organised Safe: 52 names (patterns A: 10, B: 11, C: 5, E: 26); T3 Part of You: 46 names (patterns A: 8, B: 8, C: 4, E: 26); T4 Worn Out Loud: 49 names (patterns A: 8, B: 8, C: 5, E: 28); T5 Easy Hair System: 45 names (patterns A: 8, B: 10, C: 5, E: 22). No territory fell below 40. The -ella and -anda endings across Patterns A, B, and C consistently produced the highest I scores (5), with the -andra ending producing several top-scoring new blends (Durmella, Manandra, Stivandra, Tracandra, Mostrandra, Sfogandra, Brillandra). Pattern B source words proving most fruitful were: **stays, holds, wears, lasts, held** (T1), **stowed, sorted, found, tracked, safe** (T2), **own, yours, habit** (T3), **shown, front, bold, out** (T4), and **easy, quick, done, just, self** (T5). Among Pattern C fragment blends, the ten+della and dur+tiene combinations produced the strongest results. Pattern E Italian vocabulary neighbourhood proved productive for T1 (duratura, rimasta, ferrata, salda, tenace) and T4 (scintilla, brillantina, vistosa, spiccata). The primary reason for elimination in the pre-scoring gate was phonetic near-repetition of R6 names (e.g. Tracella was borderline but distinguished by new provenance structure) — exact R6 matches were removed in all cases.
