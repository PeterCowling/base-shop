        "The best tasting spots are on Via dei Mulini and the streets behind Chiesa Nuova — away from the waterfront tourist traps. Look for family-run shops with plain signage and locals browsing; they're less pushy and the limoncello is often stronger and less sugary.",
        "Pair your tasting with free lemon candy samples (most shops offer these) or grab a €1.50 lemon granita from a gelateria to cleanse your palate between pours.",

        "Pro tip from the hostel: the shops on Via Cristoforo Colombo (the road that winds up from Chiesa Nuova) often have fewer tourists and more generous pours. We've seen locals bring their own bottles back for refills at wholesale prices — a sign you've found the real deal."
