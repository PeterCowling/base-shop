  "intro": [
    "The Sentiero degli Dei (Path of the Gods) strings together cliff-top terraces, chestnut groves, and sweeping views across the Amalfi Coast. From Hostel Brikette you can reach the trail by combining local ferries and SITA buses without joining a pricey tour.",
    "Three main approaches start from the hostel: sailing to Amalfi and bussing up to Bomerano, riding the bus network the whole way, or skipping the transfers and hiking an out-and-back from Nocelle. Use this overview to decide which detailed route suits your time, budget, and comfort with heights."

        "[Ferry via Amalfi guide](guide:pathOfTheGodsFerry): walk to Spiaggia Grande, sail to Amalfi, bus uphill to Bomerano, hike to Nocelle, and ride the shuttle back. Longest day but pairs sea views with time in Amalfi.",
        "[Bus via Amalfi guide](guide:pathOfTheGodsBus): buy tickets at Bar Internazionale, take the SITA bus to Amalfi, connect to the Agerola service, then follow the classic Bomerano → Nocelle traverse. Best when seas are rough or ferries are sold out.",
        "[Direct Nocelle loop guide](guide:pathOfTheGodsNocelle): catch the Montepertuso–Nocelle minibus, walk the panoramic out-and-back toward Colle Serra, and return on the same bus. Ideal for a lighter day or to avoid tight transfers."
