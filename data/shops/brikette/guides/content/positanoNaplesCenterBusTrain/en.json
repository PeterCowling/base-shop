    "title": "Positano to Naples Center – Bus then Train",
    "body": "This guide covers the door-to-door journey from Hostel Brikette to Napoli Piazza Garibaldi using public transport. You'll take the SITA Sud bus from Chiesa Nuova to Sorrento (approx. €2.50, 50 minutes), then switch to the Circumvesuviana train to Naples city center (approx. €4.00, 65 minutes). Total journey time is around 2–2.5 hours, and the combined cost is roughly €6.50.\n\nThis is the most economical route to Naples when ferries aren't running (October to March) or when you want to avoid taxi fares. The main gotchas: buy SITA tickets before boarding (not available on the bus), arrive early in summer to secure a seat, and validate your train ticket before boarding to avoid fines. If you're carrying large luggage, consider a private transfer instead—the bus and train can be crowded and have limited luggage space. Contact hostel reception for assistance arranging transfers."

The Circumvesuviana train from Sorrento to Napoli Garibaldi runs approximately every 20–30 minutes throughout the day.\n\nIn summer (June–September), add buffer time: buses fill quickly, and you may need to wait for the next departure if you can't board. In winter, check timetables in advance as SITA reduces frequency and the Circumvesuviana occasionally experiences delays or cancellations due to maintenance or strikes.",
