# XA — Business Plan

## Strategy

### Current Focus (2026-02-11)

1. **Outcome Contract Definition** (Priority: High)
   - Status: XA planning scaffold created; current-cycle outcome contract not yet locked.
   - Next: Define one 30-90 day outcome with baseline, target, owner, date, and decision link.

2. **Channel Validation** (Priority: High)
   - Status: Channel priorities are not yet ranked by evidence.
   - Next: Select initial channel sequence and define go/hold criteria for each.

3. **Operating Model Boundaries** (Priority: Medium)
   - Status: Role split and tooling boundaries are not yet explicit.
   - Next: Document decision ownership and required tooling baseline before scaling work.

## Risks

### Active Risks

- **Outcome Ambiguity** (Severity: High, Added: 2026-02-11)
  - Source: No explicit outcome contract for the current period.
  - Impact: Ideas may optimize activity rather than business results.
  - Mitigation: Add outcome contract fields and weekly leading indicators.

- **Channel Spread Risk** (Severity: Medium, Added: 2026-02-11)
  - Source: Potential to pursue multiple channels without ranked sequencing.
  - Impact: Diluted effort and slow signal collection.
  - Mitigation: Define one primary channel and one fallback with explicit thresholds.

## Metrics

### Commercial Validation (Established: 2026-02-11)

- **Primary Outcome Metric:** Not measured
  - Target: Define baseline and target in the outcome contract
  - Measurement: Decision-linked metric with weekly cadence

- **Channel Conversion Signal:** Not measured
  - Target: Define minimum viable conversion threshold
  - Measurement: Weekly channel scorecard
