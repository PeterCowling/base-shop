If you are booking on behalf of someone else, please ensure you have written permission from the card holder, or contact us so we can arrange a secure third-party payment link.",
        "**Availability and Counter-offers**",
        "In high-demand periods such as June to September, certain room types may sell out fast. If your preferred dorm bed or private room is unavailable, we'll promptly send you a friendly counter-offer suggesting alternative dates or room categories. Feel free to accept, reject, or negotiate - our team is all based here in the Amalfi Coast and will help you lock in the ideal hostel experience.",
        "**Confirming Your Room Booking**",
        "Your reservation is considered confirmed the instant you receive our automated confirmation email. This document details your booking reference, arrival date, number of nights, bed type (mixed dorm, female-only dorm, or private room), and total cost. Keep this email handy - you'll need to show it at check-in if your surname doesn't match the booking name.",
        "**Online Travel Agencies**",

To protect our small, independent business from lost revenue, no-shows are charged the full first night or the entire non-refundable balance, whichever amount is greater. If you anticipate a late arrival, simply email us before 21:00 so we can arrange a late self-check-in kit.",

        "**Cancellation Notice Period**",
        "Unless otherwise stated on your rate plan, a standard 72-hour cancellation policy applies. This means you must cancel by 15:00, three full days before your arrival date, to avoid charges.

        "**Cancellation Administration Fees**",
