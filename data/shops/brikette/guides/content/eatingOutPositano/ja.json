    "**Transport:** Detailed step-by-step directions below for every restaurant from the hostel. Walk to nearby spots (2-12 min), use the interno bus for main beach restaurants (€1.30), or catch the free shuttle to La Tagliata. La Gavitella in Praiano connects via boat from the main beach.",
    "Positano's dining scene spans simple pizza counters to celebration tasting menus. Prices climb as you head toward the waterfront, so we mix local restaurants near the hostel with special-occasion spots for special nights. After hosting hundreds of guests every summer, the spots below get booked fast in summer—reserve tables 2-3 days ahead for 8:30-10pm seatings, especially in summer (June-September)."

Grab a margherita or capricciosa slice, eat on the terrace upstairs at the hostel, and save energy for exploring the next day.",

The family-run kitchen can make vegetarian meals (ask for pasta al pomodoro or melanzane parmigiana) and can do gluten-free if you call first. We send guests here when they want a proper sit-down meal without the hike to the main beach.",

Book window tables for sunset if you're celebrating something special.",

These spots handle dietary restrictions well—vegan and gluten-free options are clearly marked on menus.",

The %LINK:positanoMainBeach|interno bus% runs until late, so you can ride back uphill to the hostel stop (€1.30) instead of climbing 300+ stairs after dinner.",

        "Guests rave about La Tagliata every summer, but expect a 2-3 hour meal with family-style service (they bring food until you surrender). Not ideal if you're rushing to catch the last ferry or have strict dietary needs—the menu has lots of meat and few vegan options.",
        "**Il Ritrovo** (Montepertuso) and **La Taverna del Leone** (near Laurito) complete the countryside options. Both cost €45-55, are reachable by %LINK:sitaTickets|SITA bus%, and serve generous portions in a relaxed setting.

Bus option: Walk right to the Chiesa Nuova interno bus stop (1 min), catch the interno bus toward Spiaggia/Beach (€1.30), ride 5 minutes to the beach stop, walk 2 minutes to the restaurant.

Get off at the Montepertuso stop (ask the driver), then walk 10 minutes uphill on Via Tagliata—it's a narrow road with occasional cars, so stay to the side.

Return boat schedule posted at the beach—last boat usually 8-9pm. Bus route: From Chiesa Nuova, take SITA bus toward Amalfi, ride 12-15 minutes to Praiano stop.
