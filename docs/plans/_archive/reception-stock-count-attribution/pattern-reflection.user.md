# Pattern Reflection

## Patterns

None identified. This build was a minimal single-file display change with no new external dependencies, no new packages, no recurring workflow gaps, and no access issues discovered mid-build. The precedent pattern (`StockManagement.tsx` rendering `entry.user`) was known and confirmed before build start.

## Access Declarations

None identified. All data access required for this build (Firebase ledger entries, `@acme/design-system` table primitives, `@testing-library/react` `within`) was verified upfront and pre-configured in the monorepo. No mid-build access gap was encountered.
