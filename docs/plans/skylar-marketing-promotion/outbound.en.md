## Identity (general)

Skylar builds and operates a portfolio across hospitality and consumer commerce, run on a documented operating loop ("Startup Loop") that keeps execution disciplined.

**What we are not**
We are not for hire. We do not sell venture studio services.

**Contact (single endpoint)**
Email: `support@skylarsrl.com`

Use subject prefixes to segment intent:
- `[FINANCE]` inventory/capex/growth financing
- `[SUPPLIER]` factory/logistics introduction
- `[CUSTOMER]` products/hospitality

## 30-second pitch variants

### Finance
We are an operator-led portfolio spanning hospitality assets on the Amalfi Coast and consumer commerce. We control sourcing, distribution, and the platform layer, and we run a documented weekly decision loop so capital is deployed with discipline. We are looking for financing partners for inventory, capex, and controlled growth across the portfolio.

### Supplier
We are a direct operator: we design products, place orders ourselves, and sell through our channels. We move quickly on sampling, QC, packaging specs, and lead times, and we value consistent quality and documentation. If you can deliver repeatable production, we can build a long-term relationship.

### Customer
We build functional products and operate hospitality spaces we would want to use ourselves. We stay close to manufacturing details, keep design understated, and obsess over the end-to-end experience from first use to support.

Hi <Name>,

Skylar is a direct operator: we design products, place orders ourselves, and sell through our channels. We care about repeatable quality, clear documentation, and reliable lead times.

If your factory is strong in <category>, can you share:
- MOQ ranges
- typical lead times
- how you handle sampling and QC
- what documentation you can provide (materials, compliance, packaging)

If it looks like a fit, we can move quickly.

Best,
<Cristiana / Skylar>
