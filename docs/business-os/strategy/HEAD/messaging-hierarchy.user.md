# HEAD Messaging Hierarchy (Draft)

## 1) Core Message

**Secure wear for busy days. Calmer routines. Made to be worn proudly.**

## 2) Primary Message Pillars

### Pillar A: Secure Everyday Wear (non-medical)

- Keep processors more secure during daily movement
- Reduce drop/loss moments in school, play, and active routines
- Comfort-first fit and routine reliability

### Pillar B: Routine Simplicity

- Bundle-ready system for school/travel/day-to-day setup
- Organiser-first thinking reduces "where did it go?" friction
- Clear product-family naming for fast caregiver decisions

### Pillar C: Confident Personal Style

- Designed to be worn proudly
- Personalisation without concealment framing
- Lifestyle tone over clinical tone

## 3) Supporting Proof Themes

- Manufacturer ecosystems validate retention, storage, and water-day routine demand.
- Independent markets validate textile demand and repeatable accessory behavior.
- Top-3 MVP lane is selected for high impact with lower claim-drift risk.

## 4) Segment-Specific Message Priorities

### ICP-A (caregivers)

1. Secure wear and fewer lost-part incidents
2. School-ready routine reliability
3. Calm, clear, non-clinical purchase guidance

### ICP-B (active wearers)

1. Secure fit through movement
2. Low-friction organisation
3. Style options that feel normalised and modern

## 5) Copy Guardrails

### Approved language

- comfort
- secure wear
- reduced drop/loss incidents
- organisation and routine ease
- style/personalisation

### Prohibited language

- improve hearing
- therapy/treatment/rehabilitation
- essential for implant function
- concealment-first framing ("hide", "invisible", "discreet" as primary promise)

## 6) Message Stack by Surface

- **Hero/PDP headline:** secure wear + calmer routines
- **PDP body:** fit guidance, routine scenarios, bundle logic
- **Cart/upsell:** spare-first prompts (school/travel), patch/pod attachment prompts
- **Support scripts:** compatibility clarity, expectation setting, non-medical framing

## 7) Draft-to-Active Criteria

- Add validated customer language excerpts from support and community feedback
- Add channel-level message performance deltas (CVR/AOV/return reason impact)
- Complete legal copy review checklist for claim-boundary compliance
