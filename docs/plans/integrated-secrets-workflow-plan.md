# Integrated Secrets Workflow Plan (Remove `TODO_` Launch Bottleneck)

## Team Context (Efficiency Constraints)

This repo currently has **one human contributor** and **two agents** working on it. The workflow should:

- Optimise for **single-operator speed** (minimal setup, minimal ceremony).
- Avoid “team infra” overhead unless it buys immediate launch reliability.
- Treat the human as the **only source of real secret values** (agents wire the workflow + guardrails, but should never invent or request secrets to be pasted into chat).

## Execution Strategy (1 Human + 2 Agents)

- **Human (custodian):** choose/confirm conventions, generate/store the age key, add CI secret(s), and approve merges.
- **Agent A:** do the inventory + classification work (what keys exist, where used, build-time vs runtime).
- **Agent B:** implement the fast deploy gate that blocks `TODO_` placeholders and wire it into deploy workflows.
- Keep PRs small: land the deploy gate early even before full SOPS integration (it immediately prevents wasted deploys).

## Summary

Production rollouts are currently slowed and risk-prone because secrets provisioning is manual and `.env` creation can emit `TODO_` placeholders. This plan defines a repo-standard, non-interactive secrets workflow that:

- Works for “new shop in under 3 hours” launches.
- Integrates with existing shop scaffolding + CI setup.
- Prevents deployments that still contain placeholder secrets.

Source: `docs/repo-quality-audit-2026-01.md` (Recommendation P0.2, “Environment and Secrets” gap).

## Findings / Gaps (from audit)

- Provider secrets are not centrally managed; operators must manually gather and inject keys.
- `TODO_` placeholders are useful for scaffolding but become a hard blocker for real deploys.
- CI and deployment workflows don’t have a universal guardrail to fail fast on placeholder secrets.

## Goals (Outcomes)

1. A single documented workflow to provision + inject secrets for a new shop (local + CI).
2. Non-interactive path: CLI can create a shop with deployable env (no `TODO_` for required keys).
3. CI guardrails: deployments fail if required secrets are missing/placeholder.
4. Clear auditability: we can enumerate which secrets are required per shop/app and where they live.

## Non-Goals

- Choosing/creating provider accounts (Stripe, shipping, CMS) for operators.
- Cleaning git history of leaked secrets (separate security task), beyond adding guardrails to prevent repeats.
- Full “domain + analytics” launch automation (tracked elsewhere).

## Decision: Secrets Backend (Optimised for Solo Repo)

Default for this repo: **encrypted env templates** (fastest to adopt for a single operator; works in CI; no external service required).

Keep **Vault** as a future option if/when the contributor set expands or operational requirements demand it.

Backend options:

1. **Vault** (centralised, best for teams)
2. **Encrypted env templates** (repo-managed, e.g. SOPS/age)

Selection criteria:
- Works in CI (GitHub Actions / Cloudflare deploy workflows)
- Works locally for agents (non-interactive when needed)
- Least operational overhead for “launch in <3h”
- Supports per-shop scoping and rotation

## Task Ordering / Dependencies

Primary path:

`SEC-01` → `SEC-02` → `SEC-03` → `SEC-04` → `SEC-05` → `SEC-06`

Notes:

- `SEC-01` (inventory + build/runtime classification) should be completed before finalising `SEC-02` policy and `SEC-05` wiring.
- `SEC-03` (SOPS/age conventions + bootstrap) must precede `SEC-04` (script integration).
- `SEC-07` (rotation/rollback) can be done after `SEC-05` but should be completed before declaring the workflow “launch-ready”.

## Decisions Needed (Lock Before SEC-03)

- [ ] Confirm encrypted file location and naming convention (see proposed defaults below).
- [ ] Confirm age key bootstrap and storage (local + CI secret names).
- [ ] Confirm build-time vs runtime env classification rules for Next.js on Pages in this repo.
- [ ] Confirm the rollback mechanism for a bad secret deploy (recommended: revert encrypted file commit + redeploy).

## Conventions (Proposed Defaults)

- **Encrypted env file (committed):** `apps/<app-or-shop>/.env.sops`
- **Plain env file (NOT committed):** `apps/<app-or-shop>/.env` (generated by decrypt step and/or `init-shop`)
- **Age key (local):** `~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt` (operator-owned)
- **Age key (CI):** GitHub Actions secret `SOPS_AGE_KEY` (contents = the age private key)
- **CI decrypt step contract:** decrypt `apps/<app-or-shop>/.env.sops` → `apps/<app-or-shop>/.env` before build/deploy
- **Environment split (only if needed):** add `apps/<app>/.env.preview.sops` / `apps/<app>/.env.production.sops` later; start with a single `.env.sops` to stay lean

## Operations: Rotation & Rollback (Lean Story)

- **Rotate a secret:** update provider key → update `apps/<app>/.env.sops` (via `sops`) → commit → deploy.
- **Rollback a bad secret:** revert the commit that changed `apps/<app>/.env.sops` → redeploy.
- **Auditability:** git history provides an encrypted change log without exposing plaintext.

## Active Tasks (Lean Path)

- [ ] **SEC-01: Inventory required secrets + classify build-time vs runtime**
  - Affects: `scripts/src/quickstart-shop.ts`, `scripts/src/initShop.ts`, `scripts/src/setup-ci.ts`, provider plugin metadata, `.github/workflows/*`
  - Output: a canonical list of env vars per shop/app with:
    - Where used (code entrypoints)
    - Required for deploy vs optional
    - Build-time vs runtime requirement (esp. Next.js on Pages)
    - Current source of truth (manual, CI secret, etc.)

- [ ] **SEC-02: Define placeholder policy + add a fast “no TODO_ in deploy” gate**
  - Depends on: `SEC-01` (to decide which keys are deploy-required)
  - Define which keys may be scaffolded as `TODO_` (dev-only) vs must be real for deploy.
  - Add a fast check (script + CI step) that fails on placeholder values for required deploy keys.
  - This is the quickest win for a solo operator: it prevents wasted deploy attempts before secrets are actually provisioned.

- [ ] **SEC-03: Implement encrypted env templates (SOPS/age) as the default**
  - Depends on: Decisions Needed (and `SEC-01` classification)
  - Define a simple convention for where encrypted env lives (per shop/app) and how it is materialised into `.env` for local + CI.
  - Document one-time bootstrap steps for the single operator (key generation/storage, CI secret setup).

- [ ] **SEC-04: Integrate “secrets materialisation” into `init-shop` / `quickstart-shop` / `setup-ci`**
  - Depends on: `SEC-03`
  - Add a non-interactive path to populate `.env` from the chosen backend (during `init-shop` / `quickstart-shop`).
  - Ensure `setup-ci` can emit workflows that decrypt env in CI from GitHub secrets (single operator sets the secret once).

- [ ] **SEC-05: Wire CI/CD + deploy adapters to consume secrets consistently**
  - Depends on: `SEC-02` and `SEC-04`
  - Update generated shop workflows to avoid unfiltered tests (already a known issue) and to include secrets validation + fetch steps.
  - Ensure deploy adapters receive correct runtime env (no placeholders).

- [ ] **SEC-06: Documentation + runbook updates**
  - Depends on: `SEC-02`..`SEC-05` (so docs match reality)
  - Add a short “New shop secrets” guide and link it from `AGENTS.md` and launch docs.
  - Include a minimal checklist: provision → validate → deploy → post-deploy smoke.
  - Include rotation + rollback procedures (git revert + redeploy) and a short migration guide for existing apps/shops.

- [ ] **SEC-07: Rotation + rollback drill (single representative app/shop)**
  - Depends on: `SEC-05`
  - Do one safe end-to-end exercise (staging/preview if available): rotate one secret → deploy → rollback via revert → deploy again.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Encrypted env templates are documented and reproducible for a new shop (Vault remains optional/future).
- [ ] A new shop can be scaffolded with a deployable env without manually hunting keys across docs.
- [ ] CI fails fast if required deploy-time secrets are missing or still `TODO_`.
- [ ] `setup-ci` output uses the standard workflow and passes repo testing policy constraints.
- [ ] Rotation and rollback are documented and proven once via `SEC-07`.
- [ ] Existing apps/shops have a documented migration path (bulk migration may be deferred).

## Dependencies / Related Work

- CI + deploy workflow standardisation: `docs/plans/ci-deploy/ci-and-deploy-roadmap.md`
- Launch pipeline consolidation (P0.1) and mandatory post-deploy checks (P0.3): `docs/repo-quality-audit-2026-01.md`

## Risks / Open Questions

- How should secrets be scoped (per shop, per app, per environment) to avoid cross-shop leakage?
- Which secrets must exist at build time vs runtime (especially for Next.js on Pages)?
- Back-compat: how to migrate existing shops that currently rely on manual `.env` handling?
