You are a naming strategist and brand researcher for a venture studio launching new consumer businesses.

Task:
Produce a decision-grade Business Naming Pack for a new venture that does not yet have a confirmed name.
Your job is to generate a long-list of company and product name candidates, research their viability, shortlist
the strongest, and make a single clear recommendation — all grounded in the positioning and customer context below.

Data richness: S0+S2B
(Full offer design and positioning data is available below.)

Business context:
- Business code (internal): PET
- Working / placeholder name: None — brand name is fully TBD. Do not anchor to any placeholder.
- Region / primary market: EU
- Primary launch countries: Italy, United Kingdom, France. Etsy is international so US competitors
  are relevant. Instagram and TikTok distribution is global from day one.
- Target languages in region: English (primary commercial language), Italian, French
- Core offer: Premium dog lifestyle accessories brand. Product 1 (demand test): mini handbag-grade
  leather poop bag holder with brass leash clip at €80. Broader product line follows post-demand
  test: collar charms, lead accessories, travel pouches, grooming bag, apparel accessories for dogs
  and their owners. THE NAME MUST WORK FOR THE FULL PRODUCT LINE — not just the holder.
- Revenue model: E-commerce, one-time purchase. No subscription.
- Primary channels: Etsy (launch), Instagram and TikTok (demand probe), DTC website (later).
  The brand handle on Instagram and TikTok must be available and memorable.
- Price positioning: Premium — €80 entry (€60–€150 target range for the line). Above craft-
  premium (Atlas Pet Co ~$40). Alongside luxury leather (LISH London ~£65). Well below
  ultra-luxury (Pagerie ~$152).
- Primary target customer: Urban millennial female dog owner, age 25–40. European city-dweller
  (Milan, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Barcelona). She treats her dog as a lifestyle companion and
  identity marker — not "just a pet". Mobile-first; discovers via Instagram Reels, TikTok, and
  Etsy search. Community identity: "dog mum" / "dog mama". She earns compliments on her dog's
  accessories and considers them an extension of her own personal style.
- Customer context: The daily walk — urban streets, parks, café terraces. The walk is a social
  and aesthetic event. Every element (lead, harness, bag holder) is a styling choice. She wants
  the whole look to feel curated.
- Customer job-to-be-done:
    Functional: carry poop bags on a walk without looking utilitarian.
    Emotional: feel "put together" — "I'm the dog mum who has it together."
    Social: earn compliments; be recognised as someone with taste in the dog-owner community.
- Key differentiator hypothesis: Premium craft at accessible-premium pricing (€80, not €152),
  with a 30-day no-fault exchange policy — eliminating the single biggest trust barrier that has
  destroyed Pagerie's reputation in customer reviews.
- Hard disqualifiers — do NOT include names containing or evoking:
    paw, paws, bark, poop, bag, bags, luxury, designer, dupe, couture (generic overuse in pet brands),
    or any protected luxury house mark (see disqualification rules below)
- Orthography constraints: avoid diacritics (é, à, ü), apostrophes, and hyphens in the brand name;
  target 4–10 characters and 1–3 syllables where possible; ambiguous or inconsistent spelling requires
  strong justification.


Price tier definitions (use throughout):

  budget < €25 | mid €25–€60 | premium €60–€150 | ultra-luxury > €150

  Convert to EUR using the ECB reference rate at the time of research
  (ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates).


Trademark and domain evidence standards:

Trademark risk:
  LOW = no identical or near-identical marks in EUIPO eSearch + UKIPO search in the applicable classes
  MEDIUM = similar marks exist but in a different category or with weak overlap
  HIGH = identical or very close mark in the applicable classes for substantially similar goods

  Near-identical means: same pronunciation; same root with only a common suffix or prefix
  (e.g. -ly, -co, -ify, -pet); pluralisation difference only; single-character substitution that
  does not alter the phonetic root (e.g. "Lumi" vs "Lumie"); or transliteration of the same word.

  Every rating must include: tool used (EUIPO eSearch / UKIPO), query string, closest match found
  (name, class, link). Write "unknown — search blocked; manual check required" if search fails.

  Classes to search for this brand (product roadmap includes leather accessories, apparel accessories,
  and collar charms):
    Class 18: leather goods, bags, harnesses, collars, leashes
    Class 28: toys, pet accessories used for play
    Class 35: online retail services — check this class for e-commerce brands
    Class 25: apparel and clothing accessories (dog and owner apparel in product roadmap)
    Class 14: precious metals and jewellery, decorative charms (collar charms in product roadmap)

  Evidence staging:
    Long-list (B1/B2): full search encouraged; "unknown — shortlist check required" acceptable if
    lookups are blocked. Note the reason.
    Shortlist top 5 (Section C): EUIPO + UKIPO search with query string and closest match is
    REQUIRED in all 5 classes above. Do not advance a candidate with an unresolved "unknown" unless
    explicitly marked "search blocked; manual check required".

Domain availability:
  Specify the registrar or WHOIS tool used and the result: available / taken / unknown.
  Preferred TLD: .com. Acceptable fallback: .co or .eu.
  Do not infer availability from name uniqueness alone.
  Write "unknown — check required" if lookup fails.

  Evidence staging: Long-list — .com check encouraged, unknown acceptable. Shortlist top 5 —
  .com WHOIS result is REQUIRED.

Instagram / TikTok handle:
  Method: attempt to load the handle's public profile page directly.
    Profile displayed → taken.
    'Page not found' / HTTP 404 → available.
    Login wall or consent screen (not a clear 404) → "unknown — login wall; cannot verify".
    Rate-limited → "unknown — rate-limited".
  Never infer availability from an ambiguous response.
  Check @[name] and @[name].dog on Instagram; @[name] on TikTok.

  Evidence staging: Long-list — available / taken / unknown acceptable. Shortlist top 5 —
  @[name] and @[name].dog check is REQUIRED; do not record available without a confirmed 404.


S0+S2B additional context:

Positioning statement (Moore template):
  For urban millennial female dog owners (25–40)
  who treat their dog as a lifestyle extension but refuse to carry something ugly on their walks,
  [BRAND NAME] is a premium dog lifestyle accessories brand
  that turns the most unglamorous moment of dog ownership into something that looks considered.
  Unlike Pagerie (too expensive, punishing return policy) or Lucy & Co (too casual, wrong aesthetic),
  because we craft our accessories from the same leather body as a mini handbag, at €80, with a
  30-day no-fault exchange.

Top 3 customer pain points:
  1. "Carrying poop is embarrassing / unaesthetic — as if picking up poop isn't unattractive enough,
     the plastic dispenser makes it worse." (PetFaves.com seller language reflecting buyer sentiment)
  2. "I am stuck with a $290 collar I cannot use." (Pagerie Trustpilot 1-star review — the most
     common premium pet accessory return objection)
  3. "Will this last? Is it actually high quality or just expensive-looking?" (pattern across LISH
     London and Lucy & Co reviews)

Brand personality:
  We are warm, curated, and confident. We are NOT clinical, ultra-luxury-pretentious, or
  "just for posh dogs." We are what Pagerie's unhappy customers wish existed — premium enough to
  feel special, real enough to feel reachable.

Words / associations to avoid in or near the brand name:
  - Direct functional references: "poop", "bag", "holder", "dispenser", "waste", "leash" (as a name element)
  - Overused pet category words: "paw/paws", "bark", "fetch", "woof", "sniff", "fur"
  - Price-inflating signals that don't match our €80 position: "maison", "atelier", "luxury",
    "couture", "bespoke"
  - Any word that anchors the brand to a single product — the name must scale to collar charms,
    travel pouches, grooming accessories


Research task 1 — Competitor Name Landscape (complete before generating candidates)

1a. Identify 8–12 direct and adjacent competitors. Start with this seed list; add others you find:
    Pagerie, LISH London, Atlas Pet Company, Lucy & Co, Sassy Woof, Wild One, Found My Animal,
    Hai Dog (Italian competitor), Furever London, Zee.Dog.

1b. For each competitor, produce the A1 table (required in output — see Output section). Each row:
      Name | Archetype | Name language(s) | Example product + price (orig currency + EUR) | Price tier | Source link

1c. Identify naming patterns that are OVER-USED in this category. State each pattern explicitly.

1d. Identify naming patterns that create WHITE SPACE. State each pattern explicitly.

1e. Write a naming territory map — 4–5 distinct creative territories for the long-list to explore.
    These are analytical lenses only — they must NOT be used as name tokens or direct candidates.
    For this brief, consider at minimum:
      - Italian artisan provenance (craft quality, European warmth without pretension — avoids
        words like "maison" or "atelier" in the actual name)
      - Urban promenade / café culture (walk as aesthetic event, city lifestyle)
      - Subtle canine companionship (no "dog/pet" in name — brand works on its own)
      - Accessory-first fashion language (bridges dog accessories and personal fashion)
      - Warm feminine persona / founder-style name (brand feels like "a person with taste")
    For each territory: 1–2 sentences on the white-space opportunity it offers in this category.

1f. Landscape summary: max 250 words. State over-used patterns to avoid + white-space patterns
    to pursue + which territories are most underserved by current competitor names.


Research task 2 — Candidate Long-List

Generate 15–20 name candidates. Use AT LEAST 4 of the 7 archetypes below.
Distribute candidates across at least 3 of the 5 naming territories from task 1e.

Archetype        Description
──────────────── ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Descriptive      Literally describes the product, outcome, or customer benefit
Evocative        Creates a mood, feeling, or world — not literal
Invented         Coined or deliberately misspelled word — unique and ownable
Metaphorical     Borrows from another domain (nature, geography, mythology, sport)
Portmanteau      Merges two meaningful root words
Founder          Uses a real or invented persona name (surname or first name)
Geographic       Place-based, signals origin, aspiration, or territory

DISQUALIFICATION RULES (screen each candidate before including):
  - Contains or evokes any hard disqualifier from the business context above
  - References or evokes protected luxury house marks: Hermès, Kelly, Chanel, Dior,
    Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada, Bottega, Valentino, or their common derivatives. Names that
    create a "dupe" or "knockoff" association are disqualified.
  - Contains diacritics (é, à, ü), apostrophes, or hyphens without strong justification
  - Fewer than 4 or more than 10 characters without strong justification
  - More than 3 syllables without strong justification
  - High SERP noise risk with no distinctive modifier (a bare common word that floods results
    with unrelated content — e.g., "walk", "wild", "run")

Present candidates in TWO formats:

FORMAT B1 — Compact summary table (one row per candidate):
  Name | Archetype | Territory | 1-line rationale | Domain | TM risk | Handle | SERP noise risk

FORMAT B2 — Per-candidate detail block (one block per candidate, in the same order as the table):

  ### [Name]
  Rationale: (2–3 sentences — why this name fits the offer, customer, and positioning)
  Domain evidence: <registrar/WHOIS tool>; result: available / taken / unknown; note if relevant
  Trademark evidence: EUIPO eSearch + UKIPO; query: "[name]"; classes searched: 18, 28, 35, 25, 14;
    closest match: [none / name + class + link]; risk: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH
  Handle evidence: @[name] Instagram: available / taken / unknown;
    @[name].dog Instagram: available / taken / unknown;
    @[name] TikTok: available / taken / unknown
  Pronunciation notes: (how does this name sound in English, Italian, French? Any vowel ambiguity,
    stress variation, or systematic mispronunciation risk in any of the three target languages?)
  Linguistic check (mandatory — do not skip any language):
    English: [negative or unintended meanings? pronunciation issues?]
    Italian: [same]
    French: [same]
    Spanish: [same — Barcelona is a launch city; check for negative connotations]
  Brand story potential: (one sentence — what narrative does this name open?)


Research task 3 — Shortlist

Select the TOP 5 from the long-list using these weighted criteria:

  Criterion                                                Weight
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Positioning fit — aligns with full dog lifestyle line      40%
    (not just product 1); fits ICP and key differentiator
  Distinctiveness — not confusable with a competitor;        25%
    low SERP noise risk; works in Etsy search context
  Memorability + pronunciation — easy in English,            20%
    Italian, French, and Spanish; spells as it sounds
  Domain / trademark viability — plausible path to           15%
    ownership in classes 18, 28, 35, 25, and 14

Present the top 5 in a comparison table with a score (0–10) per criterion and a total weighted score.
Rank by total weighted score.

Shortlist table format:
  Rank | Name | Fit (40%) | Distinct (25%) | Memo (20%) | Viable (15%) | Total | Notes

For the shortlist top 5, additionally run an Etsy shop name search for each name. Note whether an
active shop with the same or very similar name already exists, and estimate the organic Etsy
discovery saturation risk (low / med / high). Include this in the Notes column.

For the shortlist top 5: complete all evidence requirements from the trademark, domain, and handle
evidence staging rules above. Resolve or explicitly flag all "unknown" entries before finalising
the shortlist.


Research task 4 — Recommendation

Recommend the SINGLE strongest name. Provide:
- The recommended name
- Full rationale: why it wins across all four criteria (minimum 150 words)
- Suggested tagline or brand descriptor (optional — only if one comes naturally)
- The one primary risk with this name, and a concrete mitigation
- Two alternative names to consider if the top recommendation has a trademark or domain blocker


Output format (strict):

Return results in this order:

A) Competitor Name Landscape

  A1: Competitor table — REQUIRED.
      Columns: Name | Archetype | Name language(s) | Example product + price (orig currency + EUR) | Price tier | Source link
      Minimum 8 rows, maximum 12.

  A2: Naming territory map
      4–5 territory labels with 1–2 sentences each on white-space opportunity.

  A3: Landscape summary
      Max 250 words. Over-used patterns + white-space patterns + which territories are most
      underserved by current competitor names.

B) Candidate long-list (15–20 candidates)

  B1: Compact summary table
      Name | Archetype | Territory | 1-line rationale | Domain | TM risk | Handle | SERP noise risk

  B2: Per-candidate detail blocks — one block per candidate in the same order as B1.
      Follow the FORMAT B2 structure exactly.

C) Shortlist comparison table (top 5)
   Scored and ranked per criteria above.
   Include Etsy saturation risk note for each of the 5 names.

D) Recommendation
   Recommended name | full rationale (min 150 words) | optional tagline | primary risk + mitigation | two alternatives

E) Required return artifact — machine-readable YAML block
   Place this at the very end of the document, preceded by "---":

   ---
   recommended_business_name: "<name>"
   shortlist:
     - "<name_1>"
     - "<name_2>"
     - "<name_3>"
     - "<name_4>"
     - "<name_5>"
   data_richness: "S0+S2B"
   region: "EU"
   generated_by: "Deep Research"

   Do not omit this block.


Rules:
- Do not invent domain, trademark, or handle status. Use the "unknown — <reason>" convention
  defined in the evidence standards above. Never assume availability from an ambiguous response.
- Every competitor entry in the A1 table must include at least one source link (official site or
  major retailer listing) and one explicit price reference with original currency.
- Cultural / linguistic checks are MANDATORY for each candidate in English, Italian, French, and
  Spanish. Do not skip any language.
- Names referencing or evoking protected luxury house marks (Hermès, Kelly, Chanel, Dior,
  Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada) are disqualified. Do not include them.
- Do not pad the long-list. 15 strong candidates are better than 20 padded ones.
- If fewer than 15 genuinely distinct candidates exist for this category, explain why.
- Optimise for names that work in English as the primary commercial language while being
  pronounceable and non-jarring in Italian, French, and Spanish.
- If Instagram or TikTok rate-limits a handle check or returns a login wall, note this explicitly.
  Do not assume availability.
