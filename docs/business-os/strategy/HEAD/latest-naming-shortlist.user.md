# HEAD Naming Shortlist (Italy-first Lifestyle Masterbrand)

## A) Decision frame

- **Recommended naming territory:** Territory B (lifestyle/everyday normalisation)
- **Brand architecture:** coined masterbrand + functional product-family descriptors
- **Why:** strongest fit with non-clinical positioning and lowest claim-drift pressure

## B) Strategic constraints (checked)

- Avoid hearing-outcome language and treatment framing
- Avoid clinic-coded generic strings (for example "hearing/ear solutions")
- Keep masterbrand independent from device/manufacturer naming conventions
- Keep descriptors functional and non-medical (Softband, Organiser Pouch, Patch Pack)

## C) Ranked direction shortlist (not legally cleared)

| Rank | Candidate | Fit with territory B | Ownability intent | Risk notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Nidilo | High | High (coined) | TM/domain clearance required |
| 2 | Telilo | High | High (coined) | TM/domain clearance required |
| 3 | Tessilo | High | Medium-High | Textile adjacency may invite descriptive overlap checks |
| 4 | Tramilo | Medium-High | High | TM/domain clearance required |
| 5 | Calafilo | Medium-High | Medium-High | TM/domain clearance required |
| 6 | Filocalma | Medium-High | Medium | Longer string; pronunciation QA needed |
| 7 | Nuvafilo | Medium | Medium-High | TM/domain clearance required |
| 8 | Nidela | Medium-High | Medium | Prior unrelated usage seen in web results; higher collision risk |

## D) Recommended two-layer system

- **Masterbrand:** one coined term from shortlist
- **Product families:**
  - Softband
  - Hardband
  - Organiser Pouch
  - Patch Pack
  - Parts Pods
  - Clip Kit (only after safety validation)

## E) Domain availability screen — 2026-02-21

| Candidate | .com status | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| Nidilo | **BLOCKED** — nidilo.com is a parked/redirecting domain (redirects to searchhounds.com article) | Eliminated — hard blocker |
| Telilo | **BLOCKED** — telilo.com listed for sale at ~$1,500 | Eliminated — hard blocker (treated same as unavailable) |
| Nidela | **BLOCKED** — nidela.com listed for sale at ~$1,500 | Eliminated — hard blocker |
| Tessilo | Available (free registration) | Survives to round 2 |
| Tramilo | Available (free registration) | Survives to round 2 |
| Calafilo | Available (free registration) | Survives to round 2 |
| Filocalma | Available (free registration) | Survives to round 2 |
| Nuvafilo | Available (free registration) | Survives to round 2 |

**Hard constraint confirmed:** `.com` must be freely available at standard registration cost. Parked domains and brokered domains at any premium are treated as hard blockers.

**Survivors carried to round-2 research:** Tessilo, Tramilo, Calafilo, Filocalma, Nuvafilo — these are context anchors for round 2, not a shortlist. Round 2 will generate fresh candidates alongside these.

**Next step:** See `docs/business-os/strategy/HEAD/naming-research-prompt-v2.md` for the round-2 deep research prompt.

## F) Mandatory clearance sequence (updated)

1. ~~Domain availability check~~ — **done 2026-02-21 (partial; 3 of 8 eliminated)**
2. Round-2 naming research → new shortlist of candidates with confirmed .com availability
3. TMview knock-out search for round-2 shortlist
4. `.it` and `.eu` domain + social handle check
5. Counsel-level trademark assessment (EU first; then UK/US expansion path)
6. Final selection + update intake/brand dossier with confirmed name

## G) Current recommendation

**Recommendation withdrawn** — top two candidates (Nidilo, Telilo) eliminated on domain availability. Proceed to round-2 naming research.

> This is a strategic recommendation only. No trademark or legal clearance is implied.
