# Handbag Accessory — Business Plan

## Strategy

### Current Focus (2026-02-11)

1. **Separate Identity from XA** (Priority: High)
   - Status: Business is now explicitly separated from XA for planning and decision-making.
   - Next: Define dedicated outcome contract and avoid shared assumptions unless explicitly linked.

2. **Core Offer and Positioning** (Priority: High)
   - Status: Offer hypothesis exists but is not encoded in measurable commercial terms.
   - Next: Define value proposition, target segment, and first proof-of-demand objective.

3. **Execution Readiness Baseline** (Priority: Medium)
   - Status: Tooling and metrics baseline for this stream is incomplete.
   - Next: Define required instrumentation for demand, conversion, and margin signals.

## Risks

### Active Risks

- **Cross-Stream Blending Risk** (Severity: High, Added: 2026-02-11)
  - Source: Prior planning treated this stream as part of XA.
  - Impact: Blurred ownership and non-comparable outcomes.
  - Mitigation: Keep standalone outcome IDs, decisions, and metrics for HBAG.

- **Premature Expansion Risk** (Severity: Medium, Added: 2026-02-11)
  - Source: Expanding SKU/channel footprint before baseline signal quality.
  - Impact: Increased complexity without decision-quality improvement.
  - Mitigation: Use a single-SKU/single-channel validation cycle first.
