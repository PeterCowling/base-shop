  "intro": [
    "Fornillo Beach is Positano’s quieter, more relaxed cove — and it is the closest “proper beach day” from %LINK:hostelBriketteToFornilloBeach|Hostel Brikette%. It has a big free area, a smaller hidden free cove, and four beach clubs in between.",
    "If you are staying with us, Fornillo is the easiest place to do a low-budget beach day without feeling stuck on Spiaggia Grande. You can swim, sunbathe, and grab a drink or panino when you want, then walk back via the promenade and catch the internal bus uphill.",
    "This guide is written for hostel guests, so it focuses on the practical stuff: where the free sections are, what each lido is like, what it costs, and how to get back up the hill without suffering. For the bigger picture, compare all the main coves in our %LINK:positanoBeaches|Positano beaches overview%.",
    "Quick rule of thumb: if you want a free spot close to the water, arrive before 10:30 in high season. If you want shade and an easy base for the day, book a lido (or be ready to pay for a parasol)."

        "Fornillo has two simple access routes. The shortcut down from %LINK:hostelBriketteToFornilloBeach|Hostel Brikette% drops you onto the left-hand end of the beach (when you are facing the sea). The waterfront promenade from %LINK:positanoMainBeach|Spiaggia Grande (the main beach)% reaches the right-hand end.",
        "Along the shoreline, the beach clubs run in sequence from the hostel side toward the main beach side: Pupetto, Da Ferdinando, Fratelli Grassi, and La Marinella. Two public zones bookend the lidos — a wide free stretch beside Pupetto and a smaller free cove beyond La Marinella.",
        "In Italy you will often see signs for “spiaggia libera” (free public beach) and “stabilimento balneare” (a concession beach club). On Fornillo, the free zones are easy to spot once you know what you are looking for: open pebble space with no reserved loungers.",
        "If your plan is: beach → shower → aperitivo → dinner, it helps to think about the return route early. The climb from Fornillo back to the hostel can feel steeper than you expect after a long day in the sun. The easiest return is usually the promenade to Spiaggia Grande, then the internal bus up to Chiesa Nuova — see our %LINK:fornilloBeachToBrikette|Fornillo → Hostel return route% for the simple version."
