# HEAD Intake Packet

## A) Intake Summary

### Core Problem (DISCOVERY-01)

Parents/caregivers of children who wear external cochlear implant (CI) sound processors, and active teen/adult wearers, lack a reliable, low-friction system to (a) keep processors secure on the head through normal activity and (b) keep small, mission-critical accessories (spare coil, batteries, pods, retention parts) organised and transferable across daily handovers.

This causes drops, near-loss events, and repeated "where is it / who has it" moments, creating daily stress, time waste, social friction, and financial risk from damage or loss of expensive components.

**Frequency:** daily (morning setup) + multiple handovers per week for the caregiver segment; several times per week for the active wearer segment.
**Severity:** high in caregiver segment — the spare coil is the most commonly lost item; a dropped processor is a high-cost replacement event. Confirmed at population level by BCIG formal lost-processor guidance.

### Key Facts

- First product lane: cross-compatible textile CI retention headbands — launch hero (`DISCOVERY-03`).
- 90-day extension lane: organiser pouch and patch packs (`DISCOVERY-03`).
- Launch surface: pre-website (`DISCOVERY-05`).
- Execution posture: speed-to-first-sales; direct sales before platform/CMS work (`DISCOVERY-05`).
- Inventory: stock purchased; in-stock date and units pending (`DISCOVERY-05`).
- Channel posture: own-site DTC primary; constrained marketplace probes for evidence capture (`DISCOVERY-05`).
- Naming: unconfirmed; working recommendation is Nidilo; Territory B coined masterbrand; TM/domain clearance required (`DISCOVERY-04`).
- Kill condition: **GO (provisional)** — three kill conditions pass; first-party WTP validation from Italian buyers is the primary open gap (`DISCOVERY-01`).

### Current Workarounds (DISCOVERY-01)

| Workaround | Structural gap |
|---|---|
| Manufacturer accessories (Cochlear, MED-EL, AB) | Brand-locked compatibility; clinical design language; no cross-brand system |
| Third-party retention products (Etsy/DTC, EUR18–38) | No range coherence; no Italian-language support; no cross-brand compatibility guarantee |
| DIY (tape, hair ties, elastic bands) | Not durable; socially awkward for school-age children; not a repeatable system |
| Behavioural compensation (restriction, extra checking) | High cognitive load; limits child activity participation; no structural fix |
| Organisation: no systematic workaround exists | Ad-hoc kit across manufacturer cases, school bags, and verbal handover instructions |

## C) ICP and Channel Packet

| Field | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| First-buyer ICP | Parents/caregivers of children wearing CI processors (~12 months–12 years); problem appears daily at morning setup, school handover, sport, bedtime, travel | DISCOVERY-01 |
| Secondary ICP | Active teen/adult CI wearers (~16–45); slippage during movement and accessory loss in transit | DISCOVERY-01 |
| Tertiary (awareness) | Gift/recommender purchasers (family, audiologists); not a primary ICP until first-party evidence exists | DISCOVERY-01 |
| Support expectation | Fast pre-purchase support for compatibility/fit uncertainty | inferred |
| Channel posture | Own-site DTC primary; constrained marketplace probes for evidence capture; Amazon deferred | DISCOVERY-05 |

## D) Constraints and Assumptions Register

| Item | Source | Evidence / note | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Speed-to-first-sales is non-negotiable | DISCOVERY-05 | Confirmed primary time constraint (DISCOVERY-05 Section A) | High |
| Pre-website launch surface is current mode | DISCOVERY-05 | Confirmed launch surface (DISCOVERY-05 Section A) | High |
| Platform-cleanup work must not delay first sale | DISCOVERY-05 | Hard stop condition confirmed (DISCOVERY-05 Section A) | High |
| Inventory is near-term available | DISCOVERY-05 | Stock purchased; in-stock date and units pending (DISCOVERY-05 Section B) | Medium |
| First-buyer ICP is caregiver-led; broader expansion is secondary | DISCOVERY-01 | DISCOVERY-01 primary segment; confirmed by community and competitor evidence | Medium |
| Kill condition: GO provisional — first-party Italian WTP is the primary open constraint | DISCOVERY-01 | All three kill conditions pass provisionally; first-party cohort not yet measured | Medium |
| Naming remains provisional until TM/domain clearance | DISCOVERY-04 | Clearance sequence (TMview, domain, counsel) not yet run (DISCOVERY-04 Section E) | Medium |
| EU MDR copy discipline: non-medical claim language only | DISCOVERY-03 | Intended-purpose is set by marketing claims, not materials; clinic-coded copy risks MDR accessory classification | High |
| Tether-class accessories excluded from MVP | DISCOVERY-03 | EN 14682 and manufacturer strangulation warnings; child-safety engineering gate required before inclusion | High |
| Eudamed actor registration mandatory from 28 May 2026 | DISCOVERY-03 | Launch window overlaps this deadline; monitor MDR classification decision; time-sensitive | High |

## E) Outcome Contract Reference

- Canonical contract (source of truth): `docs/business-os/contracts/HEAD/outcome-contract.user.md`
- Intake role: provide assumptions, constraints, and missing-data inputs to the canonical contract; this packet does not redefine target/CAC contract values.

## F) Missing-Data Checklist (to progress S1/S3)

### Operator gaps (DISCOVERY-05)

| Missing field | Why needed | Owner | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| Exact in-stock date | Required for launch timing and spend planning | Pete | critical |
| Sellable units (launch quantity) | Required for CAC guardrails and stockout risk modelling | Pete | critical |
| Processor compatibility matrix | Required to reduce wrong-buy and return risk; must cover Cochlear / MED-EL / AB main processor families | Pete | critical |
| Final pricing model (single vs bundle) | Required for contribution margin and CAC guardrails | Pete | high |
| Indicative price range | Required for forecasting and positioning | Pete | high |
| Payment provider for Italy | Required for checkout conversion confidence | Pete | high |
| Returns policy and SLA | Required for trust, compliance, and support readiness | Pete | high |

### Research gaps (DISCOVERY-01/DISCOVERY-03)

| Missing field | Why needed | Owner | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| First-party WTP validation from Italian buyers | DISCOVERY-03 caveat: EUR18–38 WTP confirmed via third-party only; Italian cohort unvalidated | Pete | critical |
| TM/domain clearance for shortlisted names | Required to confirm business name before brand commitment | Pete | high |

### First-priority validation questions (DISCOVERY-01)

Must be answered with real buyer data before advancing to S1 readiness:

1. In the last 30 days, how many times did the processor fall off or nearly fall off?
2. How many times were accessories misplaced or "couldn't find at handover"?
3. What does "success" look like in 10 seconds for the morning routine?
4. What have you already bought, and what did you like/hate specifically?
5. What price feels "obvious yes" / "maybe" / "no way" for a retention band?
6. How many would you buy: 1 for home, 1 for school bag, 1 spare?
7. What accessories are actually in your current kit (list the items)?
8. Where do accessories currently live, and which location fails most?
