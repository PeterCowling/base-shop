# Plan: Linting Enhancement for Code Quality and Maintainability

Source: Linting audit conducted 2026-01-19, cross-referenced with `docs/repo-quality-audit-2026-01.md`.

## Summary

Enhance the existing ESLint configuration with additional rules and plugins to close gaps in:
- Complexity management
- Import organization
- Promise/async error handling
- React performance guardrails
- Test hygiene

This plan directly supports the 3-hour launch readiness goal by reducing the likelihood of runtime errors, improving CI reliability, and making code reviews faster.

## Relationship to Launch Readiness Audit
