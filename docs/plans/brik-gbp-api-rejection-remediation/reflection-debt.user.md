# Reflection Debt: BRIK GBP API Rejection Remediation

## What's pending

Two things need your attention before this work is fully closed:

1. **Sign off the decision memo** — Open `docs/plans/brik-gbp-api-rejection-remediation/task-01-decision-memo.md`, read the rationale, and fill in your name and today's date in the sign-off block at the bottom. This formally closes the GBP API application track.

2. **Update the results review after you've run the Hotel Free Listing plan** — Once the Hotel Free Listing plan is underway, update `docs/plans/brik-gbp-api-rejection-remediation/results-review.user.md` with what actually happened: did the Hotel Free Listing activate? Did the monthly maintenance cadence work in practice?

## Why it matters

The decision memo sign-off is the gate that unblocks the Google Hotel Free Listing plan — the highest-value local search action available to Brikette right now. Until you sign it, that plan can't formally start.

## Due date

2026-03-04 (5 business days from build date)
