        "The SITA bus from Amalfi to Positano takes 30-40 minutes depending on traffic and stops. You'll board at Piazza Flavio Gioia in Amalfi (the main waterfront bus terminal) and travel along the stunning Amalfi Coast road with dramatic coastal views. We've timed this journey dozens of times while guiding guests, and morning buses (before 11:00) typically run closer to 30 minutes, while afternoon services can stretch to 40 minutes or more during peak season.",
        "For Hostel Brikette, get off at the Chiesa Nuova stop—not Positano Centro. Chiesa Nuova is the first stop in Positano, roughly 10 minutes before the main town. From there, it's a 5-minute walk downhill to the hostel. This is critical: we've met countless guests who missed this stop and ended up facing a steep 20-minute uphill walk back with luggage in the summer heat—something you definitely want to avoid.",
        "Buses run frequently in summer (every 30-60 minutes) but less often in winter. Always check the current timetable before traveling, especially outside peak season."

You can't miss it—it's directly in front of the tunnel entrance to Amalfi town. When we send guests from the hostel to Amalfi for the day, this is exactly where we tell them to catch the return bus.",
        "Look for the SITA bus bays marked with route numbers. Route 5070 serves Amalfi-Positano-Sorrento. The stop is clearly signed, and you'll see other travelers waiting. Our advice from experience: arrive 10 minutes early in summer, as buses can fill up and occasionally skip full stops. We've had guests miss their bus because they arrived right at departure time and the bus was already at capacity.",

We coach every arriving guest on this pronunciation before they leave for Amalfi, and drivers have told us they appreciate when travelers make the effort to ask in advance.",
        "Press the stop button as soon as you see the Chiesa Nuova sign or recognize the cluster of buildings at the hilltop. The driver will stop on the main road (Via Cristoforo Colombo). From our staff experience greeting hundreds of guests: if you're unsure, tell the driver when boarding \"Chiesa Nuova, per favore\" (please, Chiesa Nuova). Most drivers are helpful and will signal or announce your stop—we've even had drivers who remembered our hostel guests from previous trips and proactively called out the stop.",

Set a reminder on your phone 25 minutes after departure to start watching for Chiesa Nuova. If you have offline maps (Maps.me or Google Maps offline mode), follow your GPS location—Chiesa Nuova is at approximately 40.6270°N, 14.4851°E.",
        "Visual cues for Chiesa Nuova: you'll see a cluster of buildings on both sides of the road, a church with a distinctive bell tower on the right, and several shops and cafés. The bus stop has a covered shelter and usually a few people waiting. It's at a relatively flat section of the road before the dramatic descent into Positano proper.",
        "If you're traveling with a group, designate one person to watch for the stop. It's easy to miss if you're chatting or distracted by the views. Ask your hostel to send a WhatsApp message with the exact stop location before you travel—staff can share a photo or map pin."

The ride is scenic but winding—if you're prone to motion sickness, sit near the front and look at the horizon. As someone who's ridden this route countless times while training new staff, I can confirm the front-left seat offers the best combination of stability and views.",
        "There's limited space for large backpacks and suitcases. If the luggage hold is full, you'll need to keep your bag with you. From our daily experience managing guest arrivals: travel light if possible, or consider using the hostel's %LINK:porterServices|porter service% to send your bags ahead. We've seen too many travelers struggle with oversized suitcases on packed afternoon buses.",
        "The driver takes tight corners confidently (they do this route daily). Don't panic when the bus seems to skim cliff edges—it's normal, and accidents are extremely rare. These drivers navigate the route multiple times daily and have seen every possible scenario.",
        "No toilets on board, so use facilities in Amalfi before boarding. The journey is short, but good to know if traveling with kids. There's a public toilet near Piazza Flavio Gioia in Amalfi (usually €0.50), or Bar Sita has facilities for customers.",
        "The bus stops at multiple points between Amalfi and Positano, including Praiano. Each stop adds 2-5 minutes to the journey. If someone requests a stop between official stops, the driver may pull over briefly—this is normal. Just stay in your seat unless it's your stop.",
        "Air conditioning exists but isn't always effective when the bus is packed and doors open frequently. In July and August, carry water and dress in light, breathable clothing. A small handheld fan can be a lifesaver on a stationary, crowded bus.",
        "The best views are from the right side of the bus (as you face forward) when traveling from Amalfi to Positano. You'll see the full sweep of the coastline, terraced lemon groves, and dramatic cliff drops to the sea. Left side gives you mountain views and glimpses into villages."

The SITA 24-hour pass (€10) is often the smartest choice if arriving from outside the coast, as it covers your connection from Salerno or Sorrento plus several local trips.",
        "**Not validating tickets:** Even if you bought your ticket, you must stamp it in the yellow validation machine as you board. Inspectors patrol regularly, especially in summer, and won't accept \"I forgot\" as an excuse. Fines start at €50.",
        "**Waiting at the wrong stop:** In Amalfi, there are multiple bus bays at Piazza Flavio Gioia. Make sure you're waiting for Route 5070 (direction Positano-Sorrento), not routes heading inland or to Salerno. Check the electronic display or ask a local if unsure.",
        "**Bringing unsuitable luggage:** Hard-shell roller suitcases are difficult on crowded buses and the hostel's stairs. If you're staying several days, consider packing in a soft backpack or duffel. Better yet, use our %LINK:porterServices|porter service% to transport bags while you travel light.",
        "**Assuming buses run late at night:** The last bus from Amalfi to Positano typically departs around 20:00-21:00 depending on season. If you're dining in Amalfi, check the return schedule first. Missing the last bus means an expensive taxi ride (€60+) or a very uncomfortable night."
