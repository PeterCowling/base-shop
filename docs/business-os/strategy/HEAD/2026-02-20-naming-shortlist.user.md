# HEAD Naming Shortlist (Italy-first Lifestyle Masterbrand)

## A) Decision frame

- **Recommended naming territory:** Territory B (lifestyle/everyday normalisation)
- **Brand architecture:** coined masterbrand + functional product-family descriptors
- **Why:** strongest fit with non-clinical positioning and lowest claim-drift pressure

## B) Strategic constraints (checked)

- Avoid hearing-outcome language and treatment framing
- Avoid clinic-coded generic strings (for example "hearing/ear solutions")
- Keep masterbrand independent from device/manufacturer naming conventions
- Keep descriptors functional and non-medical (Softband, Organiser Pouch, Patch Pack)

## C) Ranked direction shortlist (not legally cleared)

| Rank | Candidate | Fit with territory B | Ownability intent | Risk notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Nidilo | High | High (coined) | TM/domain clearance required |
| 2 | Telilo | High | High (coined) | TM/domain clearance required |
| 3 | Tessilo | High | Medium-High | Textile adjacency may invite descriptive overlap checks |
| 4 | Tramilo | Medium-High | High | TM/domain clearance required |
| 5 | Calafilo | Medium-High | Medium-High | TM/domain clearance required |
| 6 | Filocalma | Medium-High | Medium | Longer string; pronunciation QA needed |
| 7 | Nuvafilo | Medium | Medium-High | TM/domain clearance required |
| 8 | Nidela | Medium-High | Medium | Prior unrelated usage seen in web results; higher collision risk |

## D) Recommended two-layer system

- **Masterbrand:** one coined term from shortlist
- **Product families:**
  - Softband
  - Hardband
  - Organiser Pouch
  - Patch Pack
  - Parts Pods
  - Clip Kit (only after safety validation)

## E) Mandatory clearance sequence

1. TMview knock-out search for all shortlist candidates
2. Domain availability check (`.com`, `.it`, `.eu`) and social handle availability
3. Counsel-level trademark assessment (EU first; then UK/US expansion path)
4. Final selection + update intake/brand dossier with confirmed name

## F) Current recommendation

**Recommended working name: `Nidilo`**

Reason: strongest Italy-friendly phonetics, non-clinical feel, range-stretch potential beyond headbands, and clean fit with lifestyle-first positioning.

> This is a strategic recommendation only. No trademark or legal clearance is implied.
