Most guests travel via Sorrento, so allow around 2 hours from Naples to Positano, buy SITA tickets before boarding, and message us if you are running late so we can plan your check-in.",
    "excursions": "Once you have settled in, the <a href=\"/en/experiences\">Experiences collection</a> gives door-to-door directions for the day trips our guests love—Capri ferries, Path of the Gods trailheads, Amalfi and Ravello buses, Pompeii and Vesuvius trains, and more. Skim those guides to see first departure times, ticket tips, and what to pack."
