# Reflection Debt: lp-do Skills Token Efficiency

After these skill changes are used in a live run, record what you observed and whether the intended outcome was met.

## What needs completing

Open `docs/plans/lp-do-skills-token-efficiency-post-revision/results-review.user.md` and fill in:

1. **Observed Outcomes** — what actually happened when you used the updated skills? Fewer tokens used? Any unexpected behavior? One concrete observation is enough.
2. **Intended Outcome Check → Observed** — what did you see compared to the intended goal?
3. **Intended Outcome Check → Verdict** — Met / Partially Met / Not Met

## Intended outcome (for reference)

All lp-do orchestrators ≤200 lines (three primary orchestrators); critique loop and queue check gate deduplicated into `_shared/` modules; lp-do-plan phase numbering coherent; lp-do-critique Offer Lens extracted to module.

## Due by

2026-03-05 (7 days after build completion).
