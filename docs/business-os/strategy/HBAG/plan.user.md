# Handbag Accessory — Business Plan

## Strategy

### Current Focus (2026-02-17)

1. **Separate Identity from XA** (Priority: High)
   - Status: ✅ Complete. Business explicitly separated from XA. Standalone outcome contract
     now defined (see §Outcome Contracts).

2. **Core Offer and Positioning** (Priority: High)
   - Status: ✅ Positioning tier locked — **Premium (€80–€150)**. Pete confirmed 2026-02-17.
   - Next: Photography session (TASK-06), then Etsy + Instagram demand probe.

3. **Execution Readiness Baseline** (Priority: Medium)
   - Status: In progress — PMF plan active (HBAG-004). Outcome contract defined.
   - Next: Confirm supply chain cost (TASK-02) to complete contribution margin baseline.

## Risks

### Active Risks

- **Cross-Stream Blending Risk** (Severity: High, Added: 2026-02-11)
  - Source: Prior planning treated this stream as part of XA.
  - Impact: Blurred ownership and non-comparable outcomes.
  - Mitigation: Keep standalone outcome IDs, decisions, and metrics for HBAG.

- **Premature Expansion Risk** (Severity: Medium, Added: 2026-02-11)
  - Source: Expanding SKU/channel footprint before baseline signal quality.
  - Impact: Increased complexity without decision-quality improvement.
  - Mitigation: Use a single-SKU/single-channel validation cycle first.

## Outcome Contracts

### HBAG-OUT-2026Q1-01

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Outcome-ID** | `HBAG-OUT-2026Q1-01` |
| **Outcome** | Achieve first paid demand signal: 10 sales or €500 revenue across active channels, validating premium (€80–€150) positioning for mini handbag variants |
| **Baseline** | Revenue: €0. Sales: 0. Date: 2026-02-17. Source: HBAG business plan §Metrics |
| **Target** | 10 paid sales OR €500 cumulative revenue — whichever comes first |
| **By** | 2026-05-17 (90 days) |
| **Owner** | Pete |
| **Leading-Indicator-1** | Weekly Etsy listing views + add-to-cart count (tracked in `docs/plans/mini-handbag-pmf/demand-log.md`) |
| **Leading-Indicator-2** | Weekly Instagram/TikTok DM purchase inquiries (tracked in demand-log) |
| **Decision-Link** | `DEC-HBAG-01` — if 0 sales by 2026-04-17 (60-day gate): pause channel spend, run `/lp-do-replan` on pricing and variant selection before continuing |
| **Stop/Pivot Threshold** | 0 sales across all active channels after 60 days → halt, replan. Fewer than 3 Etsy views/day after 14 days → investigate tags/title before waiting full 28 days |
| **Evidence-Pointers** | `docs/plans/mini-handbag-pmf/fact-find.md`, `docs/plans/mini-handbag-pmf/plan.md` |
