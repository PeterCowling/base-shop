# Confidence Protocol (Replan)

## Core Rule

Confidence increases only when uncertainty is reduced by evidence.

If uncertainty remains:
- keep score unchanged or lower it, or
- create explicit precursor tasks and keep downstream task below threshold.

## Promotion Rule

Promotion from `<80` to `>=80` requires:
- E2+ evidence, or
- precursor chain that resolves uncertainty before downstream implementation.

## Task Score Model

Task overall confidence = `min(Implementation, Approach, Impact)`.
