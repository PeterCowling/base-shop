# HBAG Market Intelligence — Latest

## MARKET-01 — Competitor mapping (current)

`docs/business-os/market-research/HBAG/market-01-competitor-mapping.user.md`

**Status: Draft** — 10 competitors mapped (7 Etsy-native, 3 DTC). Created 2026-02-23.
Key finding: mini handbag-shaped charms on Etsy cluster <$30; premium €80–€150 bag charm space
is dominated by bag jewellery (pearls/chains) and leather tech cases — not handbag-silhouette charms.
This is both a competitive risk (cheap lookalikes) and a price/quality wedge opportunity.

## Prior baseline

`docs/business-os/market-research/HBAG/2026-02-20-market-intelligence.user.md`

**Status: Superseded** — S2 backfill from `mini-handbag-pmf` fact-find (2026-02-17). Still valid
for H1/H2 market signals; now supplemented by MARKET-01 competitor mapping above.

## Next action

MARKET-02 (Demand evidence) — run prompt at:
`docs/business-os/market-research/HBAG/market-02-demand-evidence-prompt.md` (to be created)
