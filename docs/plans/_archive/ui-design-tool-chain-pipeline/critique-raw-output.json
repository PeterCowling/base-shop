  "note": "Round 2. All findings addressed in post-round autofixes: (1) TASK-05 Confidence header corrected from 90% to 85% with explicit min() note; (2) lp-do-factcheck criterion reworded as a single final post-build gate after all tasks complete; (3) Overall-confidence Calculation simplified — TASK-05 line now states 85% directly with no redundant correction line. Round 2 is the final round (no Criticals remain; lp_score 4.5 >= 4.0 threshold)."
