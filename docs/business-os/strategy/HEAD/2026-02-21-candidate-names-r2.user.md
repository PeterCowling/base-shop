## B) Surviving candidates — domain confirmed FREE (2026-02-21)

All eight names below: no DNS A record, no NS record, no SOA record. Standard registration available.

| Name | Source | Territory | Distinctiveness | Notes from research |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tramilo** | Round 1 (rank 4) | E — coined/invented | Coined/arbitrary (strongest ownability) | Most ownable coined core; strong parent-safe warmth; broadest expansion headroom |
| **Nuvafilo** | Round 1 (rank 7) | B/E hybrid | Coined–suggestive (soft/thread cue) | Softness + crafted feel; good bridge into pouches/covers/straps |
| **Calafilo** | Round 1 (rank 5) | B/E hybrid | Suggestive–coined | Human-sounding, warm; moderate textile adjacency |
| **Filocalma** | Round 1 (rank 6) | B — comfort/reassurance | Suggestive (calm promise) | Comfort territory leader; watch therapeutic overtone in copy |
| **Tessilo** | Round 1 (rank 3) | B — lifestyle/practical | Suggestive → borderline descriptive | Textile adjacency may compress TM strength; still high fit |
| **Aluvia** | Round 2 (new) | E — coined | Coined | Short, soft, no prior meaning; low MDR framing risk |
| **Solena** | Round 2 (new) | B/E | Coined–suggestive (bright/warm) | Bright, reassuring, non-medical; easy in Italian/English |
| **Salvara** | Round 2 (new) | A — retention/security | Suggestive | "Protective/guardian" aura; **MDR framing risk flagged** — avoid "saves/enables" copy |

---

## C) Strategic ranking

Ranked by: (1) coined ownability, (2) Italian accessibility, (3) expansion headroom, (4) MDR framing risk (lower is better).

| Rank | Name | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Tramilo** | Strongest coined signature; low clinical adjacency; high memorability in Italy and US; cleanest range expansion (clips, tethers, pouches); MDR risk negligible in the name itself |
| 2 | **Aluvia** | Highly coined; short; no semantic baggage; easy vowel flow in Italian; broad lifestyle stretch; no MDR implication |
| 3 | **Solena** | Warm, bright, friendly; reads like a brand name first; approachable for Italian-speaking parents with limited English confidence |
| 4 | **Nuvafilo** | Soft/cloud signal; accessory-range stretch; slight two-part construction feel but still smooth |
| 5 | **Calafilo** | Friendly and name-like; moderate textile adjacency reduces TM ceiling slightly |
| 6 | **Filocalma** | Strongest comfort promise; use carefully in copy to stay on the right side of "soothing accessory" vs "therapeutic product" |
| 7 | **Tessilo** | High category resonance but borderline-descriptive for TM purposes; best if positioned purely lifestyle |
| 8 | **Salvara** | Works as a Territory A (security/protection) candidate; monitor copy to avoid "device-enabling" framing under EU MDR |

## D) Recommended two-layer system (unchanged)

- **Masterbrand:** one name from shortlist above
- **Product families:** Softband · Hardband · Organiser Pouch · Patch Pack · Parts Pods · Clip Kit (post safety validation)

---

## E) Next steps

1. **Trademark pre-clearance** — screen top 4–5 names in EUIPO eSearch plus (Classes 25 and 10) and WIPO Global Brand Database
2. **`.it` and `.eu` domain check** — verify for all 8 survivors
3. **Social handle availability** — Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest at minimum
4. **Italian phonetics QA** — native-speaker read-aloud for top 3
5. **Final selection** — update intake + brand dossier
