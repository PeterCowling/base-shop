# PRODUCTS-04 — Bundle and Packaging Hypotheses

## 1. Bundle Opportunities

Caryina has a natural bundle structure: one shared architecture (the Mini Facade Micro Bag) across two functions (H1 charm, H2 AirPods holder) and three colorways (V1, V2, V3). This creates three bundle axes: cross-function, cross-colorway, and accessory add-on.

### 1A. Cross-Function Bundle: "The Pair"

**Concept:** H1 (bag charm) + H2 (AirPods holder) sold together as a matched set in the same colorway.

| Bundle | Contents | Individual Total | Bundle Price Hypothesis | Discount | Rationale |
|--------|----------|-----------------|----------------------|----------|-----------|
| Pair-V1 | H1-V1 + H2-V1 | €208 | €189 | ~9% (€19 saving) | Matched metallic set; hero bundle for product photography |
| Pair-V2 | H1-V2 + H2-V2 | €208 | €189 | ~9% | Spring/playful set |
| Pair-V3 | H1-V3 + H2-V3 | €208 | €189 | ~9% | Warm everyday set; broadest appeal |

**Pricing rationale:**
- €189 stays below the €200 psychological barrier — important for a zero-review new shop where buyer hesitation is high.
- The ~9% discount is modest enough to protect margin while giving the buyer a clear reason to add the second item. At €189, with base Etsy fees (~11%), net to seller is ~€168. Against €70 COGS (2 × €35 target), gross margin is ~€98 (52%) — comfortably above the 35% contribution margin target even with Offsite Ads.
- Coach sells individual charms at €95; a "two artisan micro-bags for less than two Coach charms" frame is defensible.

**When to introduce:** From launch. The pair bundle is Caryina's highest-AOV listing and can be a separate Etsy listing with its own photography (both items styled together on a bag).

### 1B. Cross-Colorway Bundle: "The Collector Set"

**Concept:** Three H1 charms (V1 + V2 + V3) sold as a full colorway collection.

| Bundle | Contents | Individual Total | Bundle Price Hypothesis | Discount | Rationale |
|--------|----------|-----------------|----------------------|----------|-----------|
| Collector-H1 | H1-V1 + H1-V2 + H1-V3 | €267 | €239 | ~10% (€28 saving) | "One for every mood" — collect-and-rotate logic |

**Pricing rationale:**
- €239 is below €250 (next psychological barrier) and delivers a per-unit effective price of ~€80, just below the €89 individual price.
- Net to seller after base Etsy fees (~11%): ~€213. Against €105 COGS (3 × €35), gross margin is ~€108 (45%).
- Collector/set mechanics work on Etsy — competitors like Sticky Zoo explicitly use "stackable" language and limited drops to drive multi-unit purchases.

**When to introduce:** After first 5–10 individual sales confirm that buyers want colorway choice. Premature bundling at 3× price with zero reviews is high-friction.

### 1C. Gift Bundle: "The Gift Set"

**Concept:** One H1 or H2 + scarf/strap accessory (if included in pack-out) + gift packaging, sold as a ready-to-give set.

| Bundle | Contents | Individual Total | Bundle Price Hypothesis | Discount | Rationale |
|--------|----------|-----------------|----------------------|----------|-----------|
| Gift-H1 | H1 (any colorway) + scarf + gift box | €89 + accessory cost | €99 | Packaging premium | Gift-ready; no wrapping needed; occasion-specific listing copy |
| Gift-H2 | H2 (any colorway) + scarf + gift box | €119 + accessory cost | €129 | Packaging premium | Tech + fashion gift for birthdays, Christmas, Mother's Day |

**Pricing rationale:**
- This is a **packaging premium** model, not a discount bundle. The buyer pays €10 more for gift-readiness. This is standard on Etsy — competitors like PEGAI and SexylittleVintage explicitly frame items as "gift-ready" and charge for gift wrap options.
- The scarf/strap accessory (observed in PRODUCT-01 photos, pack-out decision pending) transforms from a "nice-to-have" into a bundle differentiator. If the scarf is not included in standard pack-out, reserving it for the gift bundle increases perceived value.
- Gift bundles should have occasion-specific Etsy listings: "Birthday Gift for Her — Mini Bag Charm Gift Set," "Christmas Gift — Artisan AirPods Holder Gift Box."

**When to introduce:** From launch. Gift framing is a primary conversion driver for secondary ICP (gift buyers). Etsy sellers in the premium charm space explicitly list gifting occasions in titles.

### 1D. Mix-and-Match Bundle (deferred)

**Concept:** Buyer picks any 2 items from the full H1/H2 × V1/V2/V3 matrix at a bundle price.

**Price hypothesis:** €189 (same as The Pair).

**Why deferred:** Etsy's listing structure makes true mix-and-match bundles operationally complex (requires variations within a single listing or a custom order flow). Better to test with fixed colorway pairs first, then introduce mix-and-match if demand patterns show buyers wanting cross-colorway combinations.

## 2. Bundle Economics Summary

All figures assume target COGS of €35/unit (pending TASK-02 supplier confirmation).

| Bundle | Price | COGS | Etsy Base Fees (~11% + €0.30) | Net to Seller | Gross Margin | With Offsite Ads (~26% + €0.30) | Margin w/ Ads |
|--------|-------|------|------------------------------|--------------|-------------|--------------------------------|--------------|
| Single H1 | €89 | €35 | ~€9.93 | ~€79.07 | 49.5% | ~€65.56 | 34.3% |
| Single H2 | €119 | €35 | ~€13.17 | ~€105.83 | 59.5% | ~€87.76 | 44.3% |
| The Pair | €189 | €70 | ~€20.74 | ~€168.26 | 52.0% | ~€139.04 | 36.5% |
| Collector Set (3×H1) | €239 | €105 | ~€26.19 | ~€212.81 | 45.1% | ~€175.84 | 29.6% |
| Gift-H1 | €99 | ~€38* | ~€11.02 | ~€87.98 | 50.5% | ~€72.96 | 35.3% |
| Gift-H2 | €129 | ~€38* | ~€14.29 | ~€114.71 | 59.5% | ~€95.14 | 44.3% |

*Gift bundle COGS includes ~€3 estimated for gift packaging materials (box, tissue, ribbon).

**Key insight:** The Collector Set at €239 dips below the 35% contribution margin target when Offsite Ads are attributed (29.6%). This bundle should either: (a) be priced at €249 to recover margin, (b) be introduced only after Offsite Ads can be evaluated, or (c) be treated as a customer acquisition tool where the margin hit is accepted in exchange for 3× units out the door and a higher-value review.

## 3. Packaging Format Notes

### 3A. Standard Pack-Out (individual SKU)

| Component | Specification | Rationale |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Outer box** | Rigid card box, matte finish, Caryina wordmark | First physical brand touchpoint; must photograph well for unboxing content |
| **Colour** | Warm near-white (aligns with brand dossier `--color-bg: 38 18% 98%`) | Recessive packaging — product is the hero, not the box |
| **Interior** | Tissue paper in strawberry milk pink (`--color-primary: 355 55% 75%`) | Brand colour moment on opening; low cost; photographable |
| **Product presentation** | Micro-bag standing upright on tissue bed | Structured silhouette should be visible immediately on opening — reinforces "this is a real bag" |
| **Attachment hardware** | Clip/carabiner included loose alongside product (not pre-attached) | Lets buyer choose attachment method; reduces damage risk in transit |
| **Care card** | Small card with: care instructions, "Designed in Italy" origin note, QR code to Caryina website | Satisfies GPSR traceability expectations; drives website traffic; avoids material claims until substrate confirmed |
| **Scarf/strap accessory** | TBD — pack-out decision pending | If included: adds perceived value and unboxing moment; if reserved for gift bundle only: creates bundle differentiation |

### 3B. Gift Pack-Out (gift bundles)

| Component | Specification | Rationale |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Outer box** | Same rigid card box, slightly larger to accommodate tissue + ribbon | Consistency with standard pack-out |
| **Ribbon** | Warm sage satin ribbon (`--color-accent: 130 18% 72%`) | Brand accent colour; tied around box exterior |
| **Gift card** | Blank card with Caryina wordmark + envelope | Buyer writes personal message; standard Etsy gift expectation |
| **Scarf/strap accessory** | Included (if not in standard pack-out) | Gift bundle differentiator; adds tactile variety to the set |
| **Gift receipt** | Included by default (price removed) | Etsy buyers expect this for gifting orders; reduces recipient friction |

### 3C. Shipping Packaging

| Component | Specification | Rationale |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Outer mailer** | Rigid mailer or small shipping box; crush-resistant | Structured product must not arrive deformed; Etsy reviews frequently cite damaged packaging |
| **Padding** | Crinkle paper or bubble wrap around inner box | Protects against transit impact; crinkle paper is more "premium" than bubble wrap |
| **Customs declaration** | "Fashion accessory — bag charm" / "Fashion accessory — AirPods holder" | Correct customs category; avoids "toy" classification that could trigger different import rules |
| **Estimated cost** | ~€2–3 per shipment (mailer + padding + label) | Included in shipping charge to buyer, not absorbed into product margin |

### 3D. Packaging Cost Estimate

| Component | Est. Cost Per Unit | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Rigid card box | €1.00–€1.50 | At MOQ; custom print adds ~€0.30 |
| Tissue paper | €0.10–€0.20 | Bulk; custom colour |
| Care card | €0.05–€0.10 | Small card; bulk print |
| Gift ribbon + card (gift bundles only) | €0.50–€0.80 | Satin ribbon + blank card |
| Shipping mailer + padding | €2.00–€3.00 | Rigid mailer |
| **Total standard** | **~€3.15–€4.80** | |
| **Total gift bundle** | **~€3.65–€5.60** | |

At €35 target COGS + ~€4 packaging, the fully loaded unit cost is ~€39 — still within margin targets at both price points.

## 4. Competitor Packaging Intelligence

| Competitor | Packaging Signal | Caryina Implication |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| PEGAI | "Carefully packed in a signature gift box" — gifting language in listing | Gift-ready packaging is a conversion driver, not an afterthought |
| SexylittleVintage | Reviews mention packaging quality ("beautifully wrapped") | Unboxing experience directly influences review content |
| Sticky Zoo | "Gift-ready packaging" as a core brand promise | Packaging photographs become content assets — plan for this in product photography |
| String Ting | "Lifetime re-string guarantee" card included | Post-purchase care/guarantee signals build trust at premium prices |
| TRIMleather | Reviews mention leather smell and texture on opening | Sensory first impression matters — if Caryina's material is PU, packaging must compensate with visual/tactile quality |
| SPECSET | "Wrapped in a box; gift receipts" | Gift receipt is a baseline Etsy expectation, not a differentiator |

---

## 5. Bundle Launch Sequence

| Phase | Timing | Bundles Active | Rationale |
|-------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Launch** | Day 1 | Single H1, Single H2, The Pair (all 3 colorways), Gift-H1, Gift-H2 | 11 Etsy listings total (3 H1 + 3 H2 + 3 Pair + 1 Gift-H1 + 1 Gift-H2). Gift bundles as separate listings with occasion-targeted titles. |
| **Post first 10 sales** | ~Week 4–8 | Add Collector Set (3×H1) | Requires proof that buyers want colorway variety; high price needs review trust |
| **Post Offsite Ads evaluation** | ~Week 8–12 | Evaluate Collector Set margin; adjust pricing if needed | If Offsite Ads are attributed to Collector Set orders, margin may require price adjustment to €249 |
| **Seasonal (Jun–Sep)** | If H3 confirmed | Add Amalfi location bundles: H3 single + H3 Gift | In-destination only; not available on Etsy unless supplier graphics confirmed |
| **Post-checkpoint** | If H4 confirmed | Add dog-owner bundles: H4 single + H4 + leash clip set | Different ICP; separate listing strategy |

## 6. Open Items

| Item | Priority | Impact | Owner |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| Scarf/strap pack-out decision | P1 | Determines whether gift bundle has a physical differentiator vs standard | Pete |
| Packaging supplier + MOQ | P1 | Cost estimate is directional; real quotes needed before margin lock | Pete |
| MARKET-03 completion | P2 | Formal pricing benchmarks may adjust bundle price hypotheses | Pete |
| Etsy gift wrap feature vs custom gift listing | P2 | Etsy offers a "gift wrap" add-on option at checkout; evaluate whether this replaces the need for a separate Gift-H1/Gift-H2 listing | Pete |
| Mix-and-match bundle mechanics on Etsy | P2 | If buyer demand shows cross-colorway pairing interest, investigate Etsy variation listing structure | Pete |
| Customs classification confirmation | P2 | "Fashion accessory" is the working classification; confirm no HS code issues for EU import at €89–€239 price band | Pete |

## 7. Refresh Cadence

This document refreshes when:
- Supplier confirms unit cost (TASK-02) — triggers margin recalculation for all bundles
- Scarf/strap pack-out decision is made — triggers gift bundle structure update
- MARKET-03 pricing benchmarks complete — may adjust bundle price hypotheses
- Post-launch: after first 20 orders, incorporating actual bundle vs single-SKU purchase ratios
