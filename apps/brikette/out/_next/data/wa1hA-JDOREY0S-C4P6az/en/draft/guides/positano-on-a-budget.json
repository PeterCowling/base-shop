Reaching reception requires climbing approximately 30 outdoor stone steps from the nearest pedestrian lane, and most dormitories are a further one or two internal flights above that level. As a hostel, we do not have a conceirge service, so you will need to plan around carrying your bags youself.","arrivalByFerry":"The port is some distance from the hostel.  Whilst it can be nice to arrive by ferry, you will need to plan to get to the hostel.  We do not recommend doing so on foot, with any substantial luggage or baggage, particularly in the summer.  We recommend using Positano's registered porter services, who will bring your things direct to the hostel for you. We also recommend using the local bus service. You can get directions, along with many other useful tips, via our app, which you will receive access to when you book.","arrivalByBus":"The closest bus stop to us is 100m/300ft away.  It is flat between us and the bus stop, so you just need to plan on getting your things from the street to your room.","generalArrivalTips":"For reasons set out above, we advise packing light, using backpacks rather than wheeled suitcases, and wearing sensible shoes with grip.","reducedMobility":"If you have reduced mobility, a visual impairment, or rely on assistive devices, please email us in advance so that we can describe the layout in detail and help you assess whether the area and the hostel's building meets your personal requirements.","serviceAnimals":"Please note that we can only host certified service animals in private rooms only, subject to prior arrangement and national regulations.","assistedSleeping":"To preserve a restful atmosphere in shared spaces, devices that create continuous or intermittent sound - such as CPAP machines, white-noise generators, meditation speakers, or talking clocks - may be used only when a private room has been booked.","selfSufficiencyPolicy":"In keeping with the independent spirit of backpacking, we operate on a self-catering, self-service basis. Our small team is always happy to help, but we are not doctors, pharmacists, nurses, or professional caregivers, and cannot legally store or administer prescription medication. All guests must be able to carry their own luggage, climb the stairs described above, check themselves in and out, manage personal hygiene, and interact in social spaces, without staff intervention.","essentialMedicine":"If you travel with essential medication that requires refrigeration, we can store that for you; please email us before arrival to reserve space. The nearest pharmacy is 450 m away on Viale Pasitea and the closest public medical clinic is in Praiano, 3 km by bus. Should a health emergency occur, staff will immediately contact Italian emergency services (dial 118), but we cannot, ourselves, provide professional medical assistance on site. If during your stay it becomes apparent that you are unable to meet these minimum self-sufficiency standards, management reserves the right to terminate your reservation in accordance with Article 1382 of the Italian Civil Code. Any unused nights will be refunded minus the first night and card processing fees.","minorsPolicy":"Italian hospitality regulations are particularly clear when it comes to protecting young travellers, which we fully support. Children aged 16 and under may stay only in private rooms, when accompanied by a parent or legal guardian who is at least 18 years old, and who sleeps in the same room for the entire stay. School, sports, or scout groups under 18 must book the entire property or arrange exclusive room occupancy, and must provide a signed declaration of responsibility on official letterhead from the organising institution at least seven days before arrival. For guests who are 17 years old, mixed-gender or single-gender dormitories may be booked, provided that a supervising adult aged 18+ occupies a bed in the same dorm and submits - on arrival - either a notarised parental consent form or documented proof of guardianship. Under no circumstances can minors be left unattended in common areas. Failure to comply with the above rules will result in immediate cancellation without refund, and, where relevant, notification of local authorities as required by Italian public-safety law (Consolidated Text of Public Security, Article 109).","locationOverview":"We are located within 100m/300ft of the nearest main line bus stop, and the local bus stop. Grocery stores, an ATM/cashpoint, restaurants, and a small electronics store are also located very close to the hostel. We have a very good position for day trips and local conveniences. Positano's tourist center, beaches, and ferry port is located further away. You can get into this area using the local bus.","transportationGuide":"Reaching Positano and Hostel Brikette from Naples International Airport (Capodichino) you can take the Curreri Viaggi shuttle to Sorrento Circumvesuviana station, then hop on the SITA Sud bus toward Amalfi, disembarking at the “Positano Chiesa Nuova” stop. We provide very detailed guides on getting to the hostel, to help you plan your trip here. We recommend reading them, as it can help save you time and effort on your journey.  Seasonal ferries will drop you off at Positano port, but note that you will want to plan carefully for getting from the port to the hostel. Arriving by car is possible but not recommended: historic-centre parking is extremely limited and costs upward of €45 per day. If you really want to drive, pre-book a space at Garage Mandara and plan to unload luggage at the hostel before going to part."}},"bookingBasics":{"slug":"bookings-reservations","meta":{"title":"Booking Basics: Your Essential Guide to Staying at Hostel Brikette, Positano - the Only Hostel in Positano","description":"Discover everything you need to know before you book the only hostel in Positano, on Italy's Amalfi Coast.

You'll find us at Via Guglielmo Marconi 358, 84017 Positano, Salerno, Italy. We are perfectly located for the Amalfi Coast, being central to Amalfi, Ravello, Sorrento, and the island of Capri - making us perfect not just for Positano but also day trips to each of those places. From our panoramic terrace, you will be surrounded by mountains, and have great views of the famous limestone cliffs as they plunge into the sea below. If you're searching for affordability, social atmosphere, unbeatable views, great service, then check out Hostel Brikette.","termsAndConditions":"Our terms and conditions are transparent, concise, and designed to protect both you and us. They outline essential details like payment schedules, security deposit rules, quiet-hour policies, and guest-only access to dormitories. The terms and conditions are aligned with Italian tourism legislation and standard hostel practices across Europe. We strongly encourage all guests to familiarise themselves with these terms before arriving so that there are no surprises after check-in. By completing your booking, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and accepted Hostel Brikette's Terms & Conditions, ","youCustomerGuest":"This booking guide aims to help every guest who either stays overnight or interacts with the hostel on someone else's behalf. Whether you are a solo backpacker, a digital nomad, a couple on a romantic getaway, a group leader coordinating a school trip, or simply a temporary visitor dropping by to enjoy the terrace, these guidelines ensure that everyone is treated fairly and the hostel operates smoothly.","roomBookingRequest":"Booking your stay at Hostel Brikette is quick and secure. You can reserve directly on <a href=\"https://www.hostel-positano.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this website</a> for the best rates, flexible policies, and to gain access to complimentary breakfast and evening drinks. You can also book to stay at the hostel through trusted online travel agencies (OTAs) such as <a href=\"https://www.hostelworld.com/hostels/p/7763/hostel-brikette/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hostelworld</a> and <a href=\"https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/hostel-brikette.en-gb.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Booking.com</a>.","onlyHostelPositano":"Hostel Brikette is Positano's only hostel. Book directly or contact us to ensure you make a valid booking at our hostel. Please also note that unauthorised resale or transfer of bookings is strictly prohibited and will result in immediate cancellation without refund.","communalAreas":"Our communal areas are designed for social interaction and unrivalled Mediterranean vistas. Enjoy morning cappuccinos on our terrace, join sunset aperitivo hour overlooking Positano's bay area, or catch up on remote work in beautiful lobby equipped with free Wi-Fi. We also provide spacious, gender-segregated communal bathrooms with hot-water available 24/7. Temporary visitors may share these areas during visiting hours, as long as they present valid ID at reception.","creditCardHolder":"The credit-card holder - the person whose name appears on the card used to secure the booking - is ultimately responsible for all accommodation charges, add-ons, and penalties incurred. If you are booking on behalf of someone else, please ensure you have written permission from the card holder, or contact us so we can arrange a secure third-party payment link.","counteroffer":"In high-demand periods such as June to September, certain room types may sell out fast. If your preferred dorm bed or private room is unavailable, we'll promptly send you a friendly counter-offer suggesting alternative dates or room categories. Feel free to accept, reject, or negotiate - our team is all based here in the Amalfi Coast and will help you lock in the ideal hostel experience.","confirmedRoomBooking":"Your reservation is considered confirmed the instant you receive our automated confirmation email. This document details your booking reference, arrival date, number of nights, bed type (mixed dorm, female-only dorm, or private room), and total cost. Keep this email handy - you'll need to show it at check-in if your surname doesn't match the booking name.","noShow":"A \"no-show\" occurs when a guest fails to arrive and complete check-in by 22:00 (local time) on the scheduled arrival date. To protect our small, independent business from lost revenue, no-shows are charged the full first night or the entire non-refundable balance, whichever amount is greater. If you anticipate a late arrival, simply email us before 21:00 so we can arrange a late self-check-in kit.","roomCancellationRequest":"Plans change - we get it! If you must cancel your stay in Positano, please notify us as early as possible by emailing <a href=\"mailto:hostelpositano@gmail.com\">hostelpositano@gmail.com</a>. Early cancellations free up beds for other backpackers exploring the Amalfi Coast and may reduce or eliminate any applicable fees for you.","cancellationNoticePeriod":"Unless otherwise stated on your rate plan, a standard 72-hour cancellation policy applies. This means you must cancel by 15:00, three full days before your arrival date, to avoid charges. Non-refundable or \"early bird\" discounted rates may have different terms, so always check your confirmation email for specifics.","cancellationAdministrationFee":"A small €5 administration fee per booking may apply to cover transaction costs associated with processing refunds and updating inventory across multiple booking platforms. This fee is clearly displayed at the time of reservation and reiterated in your confirmation email.","hostelOfficialEmail":"For any official correspondence - whether it's a special request, group inquiry, or visa confirmation letter - write to our dedicated inbox at <a href=\"mailto:hostelpositano@gmail.com\">hostelpositano@gmail.com</a>. We answer emails daily from 08:00 to 22:00.","bookingChangeRequest":"Need to move your booking forward a week, add another traveller, or upgrade to a sea-view private? Send your request by email using the subject line \"Booking Change - [Your Surname, Arrival Date].\" Changes are subject to availability but we always do our best to keep guests happy and flexibility high.","designatedEmailAddress":"A valid email address is mandatory at the time of booking because it is how we send confirmation that you have booked to stay with us at Hostel Brikette. If you do not receive an email within ten minutes of booking, please check your spam folder and mark us as a safe sender. We also send access to an application that you can use to plan your travel, time whilst you are at the hostel, place orders for food and drink, and so on. This application is very helpful, and will ensure you get the most of your time at Hostel Brikette, in Positano and along the Amalfi Coast.","bookingExtensionRequest":"Once you've experienced Positano's cliffside charm, you may decide you never want to leave. No problem - email or speak to reception about extending your stay. Extra nights are granted on a first-come, first-serve basis, so let us know early, especially during the peak Amalfi Coast season.","checkInRequest":"Check-in runs daily from 15:00 to 22:00. If you reach Positano before room time, we'll store your luggage for free (we can store luggage from 10:30am, daily), so you can head straight to Spiaggia Grande, the Sentiero degli Dei hiking trail, grab a bite to eat, etc. Please have your passport or ID ready for a swift registration.","assignedRoom":"During check-in we'll assign you a bed or private room best suited to your reservation type and group size. Housekeeping prepares rooms between 10:30 and 15:00, so earlier access cannot always be guaranteed; however, our terrace are available if you'd like to freshen up immediately after arrival.","hostelRooms":"Choose among accommodation categories: 4-bed, 6-bed, 7-bed, and 8-bed dorms.  Whether you want a mixed bed or female-only room.  We have rooms with and without views.  We have a private double with en-suite. All dorms have secure lockers, reading lights, USB charging ports, WiFi, and air-conditioning.","linen":"Each guest receives freshly laundered cotton sheets, a comfy pillow, and a bath towel. For ecological reasons, we change linens every fourth night of extended stays. Additional towels are available for a small fee - just ask at reception.","roomUpgrade":"Occasionally, we surprise lucky guests with a complimentary upgrade, but we do cannot guarantee to do so, nor do we have a rewards scheme or such which promotes an upgrade chance.  Whilst paid upgrade might be possible, during peak summer months, and possibly at other busy times, it might not be possible. We recommend booking the room you want to ensure you get what you are looking for.","keycard":"We issue RFID keycards at check-in, on 10 euros deposit.  The keycard grants 24-hour access to your specific room. Lost cards incur a €10 replacement fee, so please keep yours safe. Remember to return your keycard at check-out, so that we can refund your deposit.","preauthorization":"To secure your spot, we may perform a temporary pre-authorisation on your card equal to the cost of the first night. This hold is released automatically by your bank within a few days, depending on their policies. It is not a debit - simply a guarantee that you intend to enjoy your stay at Hostel Brikette.","checkout":"Check-out time is 10:30am, giving our housekeeping team enough time to prepare rooms for incoming travellers. Before leaving, strip your bed, return your linens and keycard, and pick up any belongings from communal areas or the luggage room. Luggage storage after check-out is free until 15:30pm.","minor":"Under Italian law, anyone under 18 must present a notarised parental consent form if travelling without a legal guardian. Minors are only permitted in private rooms, and may not share mixed dormitories with unrelated adults.","complimentaryService":"If you book directly with Hostel Brikette, we can provide complimentary perks to stretch your budget: a quality breakfast and evening drinks.  All guests may receive complimentary Wi-Fi throughout the property, use of a communal fridge to store snacks, and luggage storage before check-in or after check-out. These services are complimentary, and subject to terms and conditions.","temporaryGuest":"We understand that friends and travel companions staying elsewhere may want to visit you. Temporary guests might be allowed to visit, in the lobby and terrace, between 10:30am and 20:00pm.  We need any temporary visitors to sign-in at reception with valid ID. We may decline to host temporary visitors for any reason, including that we need to ensure the safety and security of guests. Overnight stays without a booking are not permitted.","acceptedPaymentMethods":"We accept Visa and Mastercard credit or debit cards, as well as cash in euros. Corporations and universities organising group trips can pay via bank transfer by prior arrangement. Unfortunately, we do not accept American Express or cryptocurrency at this time.","prepaidNonRefundableBookings":"Pre-paid, non-refundable bookings lock in the lowest available price for your chosen dates. The total amount is charged immediately after reservation and cannot be refunded under any circumstances, even in the event of travel disruptions. This rate is ideal for travellers who are 100 % certain of their itinerary and wish to secure a bed in Positano's only hostel during the busy summer months.","firstComeFirstToChoose":"Dormitory bunks operate on a first-come, first-choose basis, allowing early arrivals the privilege of selecting top or bottom bunks. If you have mobility concerns and require a lower bunk, please note that we cannot guarantee that you will get one.","refundableBookings":"Flexible, refundable bookings offer peace of mind to travellers with uncertain schedules. Pay only a small deposit today and settle the balance on arrival. Cancellations within the permitted window incur no additional charge, and date changes are usually possible subject to availability.","proofOfIdentity":"Italian law requires us to register every guest with local authorities. Acceptable forms of ID include passport (recommended), EU national identity card, valid driver's licence, or military ID. Photocopies are not accepted. Failure to produce ID may result in denied check-in without refund.","seriousDefect":"Your comfort and safety are our top priorities. If you find any defect - from a flickering reading light to a leaky shower - alert reception immediately. We will either fix the issue on the spot or relocate you to another bed or room of equal value.","ota":"While booking directly guarantees the best price and flexibility, we proudly partner with Hostelworld, Booking.com, and other OTAs so you can read thousands of verified traveller reviews before deciding to stay at Hostel Brikette - the top-rated, only hostel on Italy's legendary Amalfi Coast."},"mediaAlt":{"aboutOurHostel":"Colourful cliffside hostel façade on the Amalfi Coast","communalAreas":"Panoramic terrace overlooking the Amalfi Coast at sunset","hostelRooms":"Shared dormitory and private ensuite room split view","linen":"Fresh linens neatly folded on a hostel bunk bed","checkInRequest":"Traveller checking in at reception with friendly staff","keycard":"Guest tapping secure keycard on door sensor","complimentaryService":"Collage of free Wi-Fi, breakfast and luggage storage","firstComeFirstToChoose":"Happy backpackers choosing bunks in a dorm room"}},"changingCancelling":{"slug":"changing-cancelling-bookings","meta":{"title":"Changing and Cancelling Your Positano Hostel Reservation","description":"Detailed guidance on your cancellation options, no-show policies, how to modify your reservation, booking transfer rules, and pre-paid non-refundable bookings at Positano's only hostel."},"headings":{"noShowCharges":"No-Show Charges","cancellationsPolicy":"Cancellation Policy","changingConfirmedBookings":"Changing Confirmed Bookings","bookingTransferability":"Booking Transferability","prepaidNonRefundableBookings":"Pre-paid, Non-Refundable Bookings"},"content":{"noShowCharges":"If you haven't checked in by 22:30 (10:30 PM) on the first day of your reservation, your booking will automatically be marked as a 'No-Show.' You will be charged the higher of either the first night's stay or your non-refundable deposit. If you hold multiple bookings, each one may carry its own cancellation notice period and fees.","cancellationsPolicy":"Send all cancellation requests in writing to our official email address (<a href=\"mailto:hostelpositano@gmail.com\">hostelpositano@gmail.com</a>). The cancellation period begins when the hostel receives your email and ends at 00:01 on your scheduled check-in date. Your booking remains active until you receive email confirmation that the cancellation has been processed. A separate Cancellation Administration Fee—usually 15% of the booking price excluding third-party commissions—will be charged. The hostel may cancel your booking without a written request if you fail to check in before reception closes on arrival day, depart early without proper notification, or violate hostel policies. If you do not provide sufficient notice, you will incur charges equivalent to a No-Show.","changingConfirmedBookings":"Existing reservations cannot be directly modified; instead, they are replaced entirely with new bookings. Email your change request to our official email address within the required notice period. You will receive an email once the change is approved. All changes are subject to room availability and other conditions.
