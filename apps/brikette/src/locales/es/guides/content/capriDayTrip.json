Toma un ferry temprano (alrededor de €20–25 por trayecto), visita los miradores gratuitos, compra comida callejera barata y regresa para las bebidas del atardecer en el hostel. La mayoría de los huéspedes hacen este viaje a mitad de semana para evitar las multitudes de cruceros del fin de semana—es una de las mejores %LINK:dayTripsAmalfi|excursiones de un día desde la Costa Amalfitana%—aquí está la ruta que funciona."

        "Why start early? The first ferry from Positano (usually around 08:20–09:00, check %HOWTO:positano-capri-ferry|current Positano→Capri ferry times%) gets you to Capri before the cruise ship crowds flood the island around 10:30. You'll have clearer photos, shorter bus queues, and cooler temps for walking. During peak season, ferry schedules can change, so always check the %LINK:ferrySchedules|latest ferry schedules% the day before you go.",
        "From the pier to Anacapri: Exit Marina Grande and turn right to the bus stop (look for Anacapri signs). The bus is about €2 each way—buy tickets at the kiosk near the funicular or on board with exact change. The ride up takes 15–20 minutes with hairpin bends and sea views.",
        "Monte Solaro chairlift: If you're okay with heights, the chairlift (€12–14 one-way, €16–18 return) takes you 589m above sea level. The ride is slow and exposed—you're dangling in an open seat—but the 360° panorama at the top is free to enjoy. Skip it if you're afraid of heights or short on cash; the views from Piazza Vittoria are still great.",
        "Breakfast in Anacapri: Grab a cornetto and espresso (€3–4 total) at a bar on Piazza Vittoria. Don't sit down for a long breakfast—you'll want that time for exploring. Save your appetite for a cheap picnic lunch later.",
        "Buy your return ferry ticket now: As soon as you arrive, go to the ferry office at Marina Grande and book your return (usually 16:30–18:00 departures work well). In July/August, boats can sell out by midday, and you don't want to be stranded or forced onto an expensive private transfer."

        "Marina Piccola beach route: From Anacapri, you can walk or bus down towards Marina Piccola (the southern beach). The walk is about 30–40 minutes downhill—nice views, but remember you'll need to climb back up or catch a bus (€2). Most budget travelers skip the paid beach clubs (€15–25 for a sunbed) and just swim from the free rocky areas.",
        "What to bring: At least 1 liter of water per person (refill at public fountains if you spot them), reef-safe sunscreen, and a small towel. Capri has very few free toilets—some cafes charge €1–2, so plan ahead or buy a drink to use their facilities.",
        "Cheap lunch options: Skip the sit-down restaurants (€15–30 per person). Instead, grab a panino or focaccia (€4–6) from a deli or supermarket. There's a small Conad supermarket in Anacapri where you can stock up on snacks, fruit, and water for half the price of tourist kiosks.",
        "The Blue Grotto debate: Tickets are €14–18 per person, but you'll wait 60–90 minutes in peak season, and it only takes 5 minutes inside the cave. We've had guests who loved it and guests who felt it was a tourist trap. If it's your dream, go early (before 10:00) or skip Anacapri entirely and focus on the grotto. Don't try to fit both in one day—you'll be rushing.",
        "For swimmers: The water is crystal clear but cold (18–22°C even in summer). If you're used to warm tropical water, bring a rash guard or wetsuit top. The rocks can be slippery and sharp—water shoes help."

        "What to see in Capri town: Walk through the famous Piazzetta (the tiny main square—overpriced cafes, but free to people-watch). Then head to Via Camerelle for window shopping (mostly luxury brands). If you have 20 minutes, walk to Giardini di Augusto (€1–2 entry)—great lookout over the Faraglioni rocks.",
        "Via Krupp note: The scenic footpath from the gardens down to Marina Piccola (Via Krupp) is often closed due to rockfall. Check locally before planning to walk it. If it's open, it's a beautiful 10-minute descent, but you'll need to climb back up or take a boat.",
        "Gelato and espresso: Budget for €3–5 for a cone or cup—Capri prices are inflated, but it's a nice way to cool down before your ferry. Avoid the Piazzetta cafes (€8 for an espresso). Walk one street back for normal prices.",
        "Getting back to Marina Grande: Leave Capri town at least 45 minutes before your ferry departure. The funicular gets packed after 16:00 when day-trippers are all heading back. If you miss your scheduled ferry, you might get standby on the next one (€20–30), but it's stressful—don't risk it.",
        "What we tell hostel guests: Most people feel rushed trying to do Anacapri, Marina Piccola, the Blue Grotto, and Capri town in one day. Pick two or three highlights, move at a relaxed pace, and save energy for swimming back in Positano when you get back. You're on holiday—don't sprint."

        "Ferry: €20–25 each way (€40–50 total return). Book direct at the pier or online—prices are usually the same, but online guarantees your seat in peak season.",
        "Local transport on Capri: €6–10 total (funicular + buses around the island). Buy single tickets as you go—there's no day pass for tourists.",
        "Chairlift (optional): €16–18 return to Monte Solaro. Worth it if you love views and heights. Skip it if you're on a tight budget—the free views from Piazza Vittoria are still stunning.",

        "Total realistic budget: €70–90 per person for a basic day (ferry, transport, cheap lunch). Add €30–50 if you do the chairlift and Blue Grotto.",
        "Insider tip from staff: Fill your water bottle at the hostel before you leave. Capri charges €3–4 for a 500ml bottle at tourist kiosks. We've seen guests save €10–15 just by bringing their own water and snacks."

      "a": [
        "Only if it's your top priority. Expect a shuttle boat ride and 60–90 minutes of waiting (longer in July/August), which squeezes the rest of your itinerary. The cave visit itself is about 5 minutes. Many budget travelers skip it and spend that time exploring free viewpoints and swimming instead."

    {
      "q": "Do I need to prebook ferry tickets?",
      "a": [
        "In high season (July–August), yes—morning ferries from Positano can sell out by the day before. In shoulder season (April–June, September–October), you can usually buy tickets on the day at the pier, but booking online the night before gives you peace of mind. Always book your return ferry as soon as you arrive on Capri to lock in your departure time."

    },
    {
      "q": "Is Capri worth it on a backpacker budget?",
      "a": [
        "Yes, if you're realistic about costs. The ferry is the big expense (€40–50 return), but once you're there, you can keep it cheap: free beaches, free viewpoints, picnic lunch from a supermarket, and public transport. Skip the Blue Grotto and chairlift if you're tight on cash. Many hostel guests say it's their favorite day trip from Positano because the island is so different from the mainland—just don't expect bargains on food and drink."
      ]
    },
    {
      "q": "What if the ferry is cancelled?",
      "a": [
        "Rough seas can cancel sailings, especially in shoulder season and winter. Check the weather forecast and morning bulletins at the pier. If your return ferry is cancelled, you'll need to either wait for the next available boat (usually the next day) or take a ferry to Sorrento and then a bus/train back to Positano. We recommend having €50–80 extra as a backup in case you get stranded—it's rare, but it happens."

    {
      "q": "Can I do Capri and Pompeii in one day?",
      "a": [
        "No, don't try. Each deserves a full day. Capri requires early morning ferry + full day on the island. %LINK:positanoPompeii|Pompeii from Positano% is a separate full-day trip via train/bus. Trying to combine them means you'll spend most of the day on transport and see very little of either. We've had guests attempt it and regret it—pick one per day."
