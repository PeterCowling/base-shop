# Startup Readiness Verdict — HBAG

**Overall**: GO

## Gate Results

### RG-01: Offer Clarity
**Status**: PASS
**Evidence**: `HBAG-offer.md` — executive summary defines two validated demand-test candidates (H1 bag charm, H2 AirPod holder) on the same physical body, ICP-A (women 25–40, aspirational handbag owners, Instagram/TikTok discovery). `HBAG-intake-packet.user.md` Section B — recommended launch prices H1 €89, H2 €119; price architecture documented; style direction (craft/material authenticity) stated.
**Value proposition**: White-space at artisan tier €80–€150 between Etsy mid-market (€15–60) and accessible luxury (€200+); Italian coastal provenance story; "one considered charm that elevates the bag."

---

### RG-02: Distribution Feasibility
**Status**: PASS
**Evidence**: `HBAG-channels.md` — 3 channels selected, all at €0 month-1 budget:
- **Etsy** (primary DTC): low cost, no infrastructure required, artisan buyer intent confirmed; `GATE-S6B-STRAT-01=PASS`.
- **Instagram/TikTok organic** (DM-to-buy): low-medium effort, matches visual discovery behaviour of ICP-A.
- **In-destination Positano** (Brikette hostel + boutique consignment, June–September): low cost, existing premises; tourist ICP-B fit confirmed.

No fatal blockers. Paid acquisition explicitly held at `GATE-S6B-ACT-01=HOLD` until ≥10 first-party demand signals.

---

### RG-03: Measurement Plan
**Status**: PASS
**Evidence**: `HBAG-intake-packet.user.md` Section E — baseline established (0 orders, €0 revenue, 2026-02-17). Tracking method: Etsy built-in analytics + manual DM log + in-destination manual count — all feasible for solo operator at launch volume.
**Metrics tracked**:
1. Weekly Etsy listing views
2. Weekly Etsy add-to-cart count
3. Weekly Etsy favourites per listing
4. Weekly Instagram/TikTok DM purchase inquiries and intent confirmations
5. Paid orders (target: 10 OR €500 net revenue by 2026-05-17)
6. Contribution margin (target: ≥35%)
7. In-destination sales count (June–September)

Success threshold: `DEC-HBAG-01` — if 0 sales after 60 days → halt, replan.

## Demand Evidence Pack (DEP) Advisory

DEP is required before `GATE-S6B-ACT-01` (paid spend authorisation). DEP status for HBAG:

**Current DEP status: Pass-floor met (market-level signals only)**

`docs/business-os/startup-baselines/HBAG/demand-evidence-pack.md` — Active.
- `GATE-S6B-STRAT-01`: PASS — channel strategy design may proceed.
- `GATE-S6B-ACT-01`: HOLD — no first-party HBAG sales data. Gates on: photography perception test (≥3/5 reviewers estimate ≥€80) + ≥10 Etsy/social sales + unit cost/margin stack confirmed.

DEP capture gaps before `GATE-S6B-ACT-01`:
- First-party Etsy performance (views, favs, add-to-carts, sales) — by TASK-09 checkpoint day 28
- Instagram/TikTok DM inquiry count — by TASK-09 checkpoint day 14
- Photography perception test result — pre-listing launch
- Unit cost + margin stack confirmed ≥35% — pre-listing launch

## Verdict

✅ All gates pass. Ready to proceed to S2B (`/lp-offer --business HBAG`).

**Open items before listing goes live (not S1 gates — tracked in intake Section F):**
- TASK-02: Supplier quote (unit cost, MOQ, China→EU shipping) — Critical
- TASK-06: Photography perception test — Critical (listing gate)
- Customer-facing brand name selection from shortlist — High
