# MARKET-04 Deep Research Prompt — Caryina (HBAG) Channel Landscape

## Context for the research agent

**Business:** Caryina — premium artisan bag accessories brand, Positano, Italy.
**Products:** H1 bag charm (€99 target), H2 AirPods holder (€89 target). Physical goods, made or sourced in Italy, shipped internationally from an Italy-based seller.
**Stage:** 90-day demand test before committing to full inventory or marketing spend.

**What MARKET-01, 02, and 03 established — do NOT re-derive these:**

From MARKET-01 (competitor mapping):
- Primary channel is Etsy. DTC competitors (Sticky Zoo, String Ting) supplement organic Etsy sales with brand-owned social presence (Instagram, TikTok).
- PEGAI ($99, 107k Etsy sales) is proof that US buyers convert at premium pricing on Etsy — but EU shipping is blocked, leaving a gap for an Italy-based seller.

From MARKET-02 (demand evidence):
- Buyer discovery path: TikTok/Instagram scroll → trend exposure → Etsy search or direct DM inquiry.
- Reddit confirms Etsy as the active search destination for artisan bag charms; buyers warn each other about reseller noise, creating an opening for credible origin proof.
- Gift buyer (ICP-B) is a structurally important segment; bag charms appear in holiday gift editorial.

From MARKET-03 (pricing benchmarks):
- €99 H1 / €89 H2 are viable on Etsy with "art object" or "micro-bag charm" framing — not tech-cover framing.
- Free shipping is a material conversion factor on Etsy for US buyers; must be baked into list price.
- Etsy charges 6.5% transaction fee + Offsite Ads fee (12–15% on attributed orders) + Italy Regulatory Operating fee. These platform costs must be factored into channel viability.
- Italian leather + brass claims are commoditised; photography and craft proof are the differentiators.

**What MARKET-04 must establish (research gaps):**
- For Etsy: what are the observable mechanics of Etsy SEO / discovery for new shops in this category? How long does it realistically take a new Etsy shop with zero reviews to get organic visibility? What are the specific Etsy onboarding requirements for Italy-based sellers (shop setup, VAT, currency, shipping zones)?
- For Instagram/TikTok organic: what content formats are driving discovery and conversion for artisan bag accessories specifically? Is TikTok Shop a viable add-on (EU availability, category eligibility)?
- For Etsy Ads: what is the realistic cost-per-click range in the "bag charm" and "AirPods leather case" categories on Etsy? Is paid discovery viable at the 90-day test stage or premature?
- For in-destination tourist channel (Positano boutique + Brikette hostel): what are the operational realities — consignment terms, who handles sales, how does inventory travel from production to point of sale?
- Are there any channel alternatives appropriate for the test phase that have not been considered? (e.g., Depop, Not On The High Street, Wolf & Badger, luxury consignment platforms)
- What are the stop conditions — i.e., what early signals on each channel should trigger pausing or redirecting channel investment?

## Research Objectives

Map the realistic acquisition and distribution channel landscape for a 90-day Etsy demand test, with secondary coverage of Instagram/TikTok organic, and a brief assessment of the Amalfi tourist channel. The goal is a channel shortlist that Caryina can begin executing immediately (Etsy launch), plus a sequenced view of which channels to add at 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day marks depending on test results. Include enough operational detail (platform setup requirements, known cost structures, early stop conditions) for the operator to make a go/no-go decision on each channel.

## Required Output Sections

### Section 1 — Candidate Channels and Fit Rationale

For each candidate channel, provide:
- Channel name and type (marketplace / owned social / paid / in-destination / wholesale)
- Fit rationale: why does this channel match Caryina's ICP discovery path and product characteristics?
- Stage fit: is this channel appropriate for the 90-day demand test, or is it a Phase 2 / post-validation addition?
- Operator requirement: what must Caryina have in place before activating this channel? (account, content, inventory, tooling)

Candidate channels to evaluate (at minimum):

**Primary:**
- Etsy (marketplace — primary channel for demand test)

**Secondary discovery:**
- Instagram organic (Reels / feed posts / Stories)
- TikTok organic (short-form video)

**Growth/supplementary:**
- TikTok Shop EU (if available for Italy-based sellers in the bag accessories category)
- Pinterest (product pins / idea pins — passive discovery)

**Alternative marketplaces to briefly assess:**
- Depop (is the premium artisan audience here or is it too value-driven?)
- Not On The High Street UK (premium artisan marketplace — eligibility and onboarding requirements)
- Wolf & Badger (premium indie brand marketplace — eligibility, consignment vs. wholesale terms)

**Tourist / in-destination:**
- Positano boutique consignment
- Brikette hostel display sales (June–September)

**Do NOT include** general DTC website launch as a channel for the demand test phase — this is post-validation. Note it briefly as a Phase 2 target if relevant.

### Section 2 — Channel Constraints (Policy, Cost, Capability, Compliance)

For each channel shortlisted in Section 1, document:

**Etsy:**
- Onboarding requirements for Italy-based sellers: what documents/setup does Etsy require? (shop name, payment account, VAT/tax setup for EU sellers, currency — EUR or GBP or USD?)
- Fee structure: transaction fee (6.5% confirmed), listing fee (€0.20/listing), Offsite Ads, Regulatory Operating fee for Italy. What is the realistic net margin on a €99 item after all Etsy fees and international shipping?
- Etsy SEO / discoverability mechanics for new shops: how does the algorithm treat listings with zero reviews? What listing optimisation is actionable from day 1 (title, tags, sections, photography requirements)?
- Italy to US/EU shipping: what are the realistic shipping cost bands and delivery time expectations from Italy for a small leather item (under 200g)? Which carriers are cost-effective for Etsy sellers shipping internationally?

**Instagram organic:**
- What account setup and content volume are required to get meaningful organic reach for a new brand account in this category? (follower count at launch is not controllable — what is the minimum viable content strategy?)
- Does Instagram Shopping (Product tags) require a Shopify or Meta Commerce store? Can it be linked to Etsy listings? What are the setup requirements?

**TikTok organic:**
- What content format has the highest discovery probability for artisan bag accessories? (Craft process videos, styling videos, "unboxing"?)
- Is TikTok Shop available in Italy for small sellers, and if so, is the bag accessories category eligible? Note any known eligibility constraints.

**Pinterest:**
- Is Pinterest product pinning (with price and direct link to Etsy listing) available for Etsy listings? What is the setup requirement?

**Alternative marketplaces (brief):**
- Wolf & Badger: eligibility criteria, application process, consignment vs. wholesale terms, typical brand tier.
- Not On The High Street: eligibility, UK-focused vs. international shipping, listing fees.
- Depop: is this the right price tier for Caryina? Any evidence of artisan premium bag accessories converting above $80 on Depop?

**Tourist channel:**
- Boutique consignment in Positano: what are typical consignment terms (% split, payment cycle, minimum quantity) in the Italian artisan retail context?
- Brikette hostel display sales: what inventory, merchandising, and handoff process would this require?

### Section 3 — Typical Conversion Path Expectations

For each shortlisted channel, describe the realistic conversion journey:
- Discovery → interest → consideration → purchase
- What is the typical decision timeline? (impulse vs. 3–7 day consideration)
- What are the most critical drop-off points?
- How does the €89–€99 price point affect the conversion path on each channel? (A $99 purchase on Etsy vs. TikTok Shop has very different consideration dynamics.)

### Section 4 — Early Stop Conditions and Risk Signals Per Channel

For each channel, define:
- What early negative signal should trigger pausing channel investment within the first 30 days?
- What would constitute a "dead signal" (no data, not a negative signal) requiring a different approach?
- What external risk could make the channel unviable mid-test? (e.g., Etsy algorithm update reducing new shop visibility; TikTok regulatory risk in key markets)

### Section 5 — Channel Shortlist Recommendations with Confidence Tags

Produce a prioritised shortlist of 3–4 channels for the 90-day test with explicit sequencing:

| Channel | Priority | Start timing | Confidence | Key prerequisite |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Etsy | Primary | Day 1 | — | — |
| Instagram organic | — | — | — | — |
| TikTok organic | — | — | — | — |
| [Other] | — | — | — | — |

For each channel recommendation, tag confidence as High / Medium / Low based on: how much evidence exists for ICP-channel fit, how well Caryina's product characteristics match the channel's conversion dynamics, and how achievable the prerequisites are for a bootstrapped Italy-based seller.

Provide a single paragraph summary of the recommended 90-day channel sequencing: what to activate on Day 1, what to add at 30 days, and what to hold for post-validation.

---

## Scope Constraints

- **Focus on the 90-day demand test**, not a full go-to-market build. Channel choices that require 3+ months of setup (e.g., own e-commerce site, wholesale network) are out of scope — note them briefly as Phase 2.
- **Geography:** EU + North America primary (Etsy buyer base). Italy secondary for tourist channel.
- **Operator constraints in scope:** Italy-based seller, bootstrapped (no paid ads budget for test phase), limited content production capacity (assume 1 person, part-time).
- **Do NOT** produce a paid advertising plan. Paid channels (Google Shopping, Meta Ads, Etsy Ads beyond basic boosting) are Phase 2 territory unless there is a specific reason to include minimal Etsy Ads at launch.

## Prior research on file (do not repeat — extend or challenge)

Already documented across MARKET-01–03:
- Etsy is the primary conversion channel; DTC social (Instagram/TikTok) drives discovery
- Buyer discovery path: TikTok/Instagram → Etsy search or direct DM
- PEGAI's EU shipping gap creates an Etsy opportunity for Italy-based seller
- Etsy fee structure: 6.5% transaction + Offsite Ads + Regulatory Operating fee (Italy)
- Free shipping is a conversion factor on Etsy for US buyers
- TRIMleather and SPECSET use gift wrap add-on and gift framing — ICP-B (gift buyer) is Etsy-reachable
- Amalfi tourist season: June–September, peak July–August

Your job is to add **channel operational mechanics** — setup requirements, conversion path detail, stop conditions, and sequencing — not to revisit market sizing or demand signals already on record.
