# Caryina — Tagline Selection

## The Decision

Choose a tagline that appears on the Caryina website header, revealed immediately after an animated logo transformation.

## Background

**Caryina** is a new handbag accessories brand selling artisan-quality bag charms (€89) and AirPods holders (€119). The products are structured micro-bags — tiny versions of real handbags with turn-lock clasps, real hardware, and architectural facade detailing. They are designed in Positano, Italy and manufactured in China.

The brand launches first in Italy, targeting fashion-aware women aged 27–42 who own premium bags (LV/Gucci entry tier, €600–€1,500+) and want a single, considered accessory that makes their bag feel personal — without looking like they're trying too hard.

## The Logo Animation

The brand name **Caryina** is displayed in the website header in Cormorant Garamond (an editorial serif). On page load, the logo plays a subtle typographic animation:

1. The word **Caryina** is shown
2. The letter **y** softly drops and fades out
3. The remaining letters slide together to form **Carina**

**Carina** is an everyday Italian word meaning **"cute"** — used as a warm, approving compliment ("che carina!"). For Italian visitors, this is instantly understood. The transformation is the brand revealing its own meaning: *we named ourselves after the very quality our accessories embody.*

## What the Tagline Must Do

The tagline fades in beneath the logo once the animation completes. It needs to:

- **Complete the reveal** — connect the word "carina" (cute) back to what the brand sells (handbag accessories)
- **Work for an Italian audience** — "carina" is obvious to them; the tagline shouldn't explain the word, it should build on it
- **Stay on-brand** — sophisticated, curated, feminine, confident. No hype language, no "luxury/premium/exclusive" claims
- **Reinforce the single-detail positioning** — Caryina sells one considered piece for your bag, not a pile-on of charms

## Approved Brand Phrases (for context)

These existing phrases define the brand voice. The tagline should complement them:

- **"Made to be shown."** — quality that reads at distance
- **"Considered detail."** — curated restraint; one piece is enough
- **"Use every day."** — not a trend buy; a keeper piece

## Options

### A. "Your accessories should be cute" — the brand name is the promise

| # | Italian | English | Notes |
|---|---------|---------|-------|
| A1 | Perché i tuoi accessori dovrebbero esserlo. | Because your accessories should be. | Confident, conversational. Completes the sentence that "carina" starts. The viewer fills in the gap. |
| A2 | Ogni borsa merita qualcosa di carino. | Every bag deserves something cute. | Warm, inclusive. Positions the product as something your bag is missing. |
| A3 | Il tuo accessorio più carino. | Your cutest accessory. | Short, direct. Works as both a tagline and a product descriptor. |
| A4 | Accessori pensati per essere carini. | Accessories designed to be cute. | "Pensati" (thought out / designed) signals intentionality — cute on purpose, not by accident. |

### B. "The name says it all" — wordplay between brand name and the word

| # | Italian | English | Notes |
|---|---------|---------|-------|
| B1 | Accessori che meritano il nome. | Accessories that deserve the name. | Double meaning: "the name" = both the brand name and the word "cute." Implies quality earns the compliment. |
| B2 | Non solo un nome. | Not just a name. | Minimal. Says: carina isn't just what we're called, it's what we make. Needs the animation to land. |
| B3 | Un nome che dice tutto. | A name that says it all. | Self-aware, confident. Risks being too meta if the viewer doesn't catch the transformation. |
| B4 | Il nome più carino per i tuoi accessori. | The cutest name for your accessories. | Playful. Directly uses "carino" again, reinforcing the wordplay. |

### C. "One cute detail" — connects carina to the single-piece positioning

| # | Italian | English | Notes |
|---|---------|---------|-------|
| C1 | Il dettaglio più carino della tua borsa. | The cutest detail on your bag. | Product-specific. "Dettaglio" echoes the brand phrase "Considered detail." Positions as one piece, not many. |
| C2 | Un dettaglio carino cambia tutto. | One cute detail changes everything. | Aspirational but grounded. The single-piece philosophy in one line. |
| C3 | Dettagli carini. Pensati bene. | Cute details. Well considered. | Two short sentences. Pairs "cute" with "considered" — the brand's core tension. |
| C4 | Un solo dettaglio. Quello carino. | One detail. The cute one. | Punchy, minimal. Anti-maximalist. |

### D. "Italian design + cute" — combines wordplay with Positano provenance

| # | Italian | English | Notes |
|---|---------|---------|-------|
| D1 | Carino per natura. Disegnato a Positano. | Cute by nature. Designed in Positano. | Two-part line. "By nature" suggests inherent quality; Positano adds aspiration and truthful origin. |
| D2 | Pensato in Italia. Carino per definizione. | Thought up in Italy. Cute by definition. | "Per definizione" = by definition — plays on the fact that the brand name literally defines itself as cute. |
| D3 | Da Positano, il dettaglio carino che mancava. | From Positano, the cute detail that was missing. | Longer but complete. Place, product, and promise in one line. |

### E. "Cute isn't accidental" — quality earns the compliment

| # | Italian | English | Notes |
|---|---------|---------|-------|
| E1 | Carino non è un caso. | Cute isn't an accident. | Confident. Signals design intentionality — these accessories are cute because of craft, not luck. |
| E2 | Fatto per essere carino. Fatto per restare. | Made to be cute. Made to last. | Parallel structure. Connects "cute" to durability — justifies the €89–€119 price. |
| E3 | Abbastanza carino da essere notato. | Cute enough to be noticed. | Quiet confidence. Echoes "Made to be noticed — quietly" from the approved variants. |
