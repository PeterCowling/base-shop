    "Arienzo Beach Positano sits just east of town with long afternoon sun, clear water, and a dramatic staircase down from the Amalfi Coast road. For Hostel Brikette guests it’s one of the easiest “treat yourself” beach days — but with stairs, boats, and reservations, it pays to have a plan.",
    "This guide is written for hostel guests: what to book, what those 300 steps really feel like, how the shuttle boat from Spiaggia Grande works, what to pack so the climb doesn’t punish you, and how to get back without stress."

      "body": [
        "Arienzo is the closest full‑service beach club that still feels away from the Spiaggia Grande crowd. The cliff terraces keep sun late into the afternoon, the water is often clear for swimming, and the bar adds energy without turning into nightlife.",
        "You can keep it simple with a day package (loungers + lunch) or go all‑in with front row for a special occasion. With a little planning you’ll skip queues, avoid “we forgot the towels” panic, and still make it back to the hostel for sunset drinks.",
        "Staff tip from reception: think of Arienzo as an afternoon beach. Going early gives you more hours, but the magic is the long light and golden hour on the water when other coves are already in shade."

        "Avoid very windy days with rough seas. Shuttle boats can pause and swimming gets choppy. If it looks wild, swap to a more sheltered plan (or do a town day and save Arienzo for a calm afternoon).",
        "In high season, weekends sell out first. Book ahead and choose a vibe that matches your energy: early for more swim time, late for sunset feels."

If your booking includes the boat, it usually tells you where to queue and what to show at the pier. Save the return times before you get in the water — it prevents “are we stranded?” stress.",
        "Prefer land? The SITA bus works. From Hostel Brikette, use the Sponda bus stop (about 10 minutes downhill) towards Amalfi. Get off at Arienzo and walk down the steps through lemon terraces to the entrance. Use %LINK:hostelBriketteToArienzoBus|our hostel → Arienzo bus guide% for step‑by‑step directions and backup stops.",
