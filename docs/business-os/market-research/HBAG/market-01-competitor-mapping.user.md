# HBAG competitor mapping for Caryina on Etsy

Caryina is testing a premium artisan "mini handbag" bag charm (H1) and matching AirPods holder (H2), with the initial demand test running on Etsy and secondarily using discovery on Instagram and TikTok. The working positioning hypothesis is a premium, story-driven "white space" between Etsy's mid-market and accessible luxury, using an Italian origin story rooted in Positano and craft-quality photography as primary differentiators.

What emerges from the current Etsy landscape is that €80–€150 premium "bag charm" exists, but it is concentrated in (a) bag jewellery / chain charms (pearls; charms-on-chain) and (b) leather tech cases with key clips. Premium "mini handbag-shaped" charms on Etsy tend to cluster far lower (often <$30), which creates both a competitive risk (cheap lookalikes) and a potential price/quality wedge if Caryina can make the object read as genuinely premium through materials, hardware, and photography.

## Section 1 — Direct Competitor Set

Below is the most relevant direct set (Etsy-first, plus a small number of style-first DTC brands that behave like "Etsy competitors" because they set expectations for photography, storytelling, and price-per-charm). "Estimated monthly sales" is generally not observable on Etsy without third-party tools; for decision-grade comparability, shop reviews, shop sales, listing "in carts / low stock / views" indicators, and recency of listings are used where available.

### SexylittleVintage (Etsy)

**Product type:** H1-adjacent "luxury bag charm keychain" (multi-charm; "designer bag" framing; vachetta language).

**Observed price point:** $69–$79 across two very similar "Luxury Bag Charm Keychain" listings (colourways differ; one is explicitly "Vachetta Lovers").

**Scale signals (observable):** ~3.7k shop reviews; ~14k+ shop sales; established shop (~7 years on Etsy).

**Positioning (their words):** "one of the Kind Luxury Fun Multi Charm Bag keychain" and "pre-owned, 100% authentic… vintage designer bags… handcrafted unique bag straps and accessories."

**Evidence links:** Etsy listings and shop profile on the listing pages.

**Confidence:** High (clear overlap on "aspirational handbag owner", premium framing, and strong Etsy scale).

---

### SPECSET (Etsy)

**Product type:** H1 direct substitute (premium "freshwater pearl bag charm" / handbag chain decoration; jewellery-adjacent).

**Observed price point:** ~$104.54 for the freshwater pearl bag charm listing.

**Scale signals (observable):** ~839 shop reviews; ~3.8k shop sales; "Star Seller"; listing shows "Low in stock".

**Positioning (their words):** "Freshwater Pearl Bag Charm: Luxury Handbag Chain Decoration" and "We believe in style at the right price… high quality materials."

**Evidence links:** Etsy listing and embedded shop/FAQ content on the same page.

**Confidence:** High (clearly premium-priced on Etsy; strong relevance as a high-visibility substitute).

---

### TRIMleather (Etsy)

**Product type:** H2 direct competitor (leather AirPods case with attachment loop/strap; "everyday carry" meets accessory).

**Observed price point:** $69.90 for "Leather Airpods Case – Honey Brown…".

**Scale signals (observable):** ~2.5k shop reviews; ~14.5k shop sales; long-running Etsy presence (14 years).

**Positioning (their words):** "Handcrafted from full-grain oil-waxed Italian cowhide" and "sturdy brass clasp."

**Evidence links:** Etsy listing and shop footer block.

**Confidence:** High (direct H2 overlap; premium-enough positioning for Etsy; strong operational maturity).

---

### PEGAI (Etsy)

**Product type:** H2 direct competitor (leather AirPods case; keychain attachment; "giftable luxury" copy; textured "python" variant).

**Observed price point:** $99 (python leather AirPods case listing).

**Scale signals (observable):** ~18.7k shop reviews; ~107k shop sales; "Star Seller"; seller story block and family branding ("The Pegai Family").

**Availability constraint:** the listing text indicates US-only shipping for the item and notes it doesn't ship to the UK (important for EU/UK demand tests).

**Positioning (their words):** "premium quality doesn't have to mean premium price" and "luxury leather goods accessible to all."

**Evidence links:** Etsy listing and shop block at bottom of the same page.

**Confidence:** High for product positioning/scale; Medium for EU-competitive relevance due to shipping constraints.

---

### NitmoiStudio (Etsy + DTC site)

**Product type:** H2 competitor (Italian leather AirPods Pro 3 case; solid brass clip; monogram options; explicitly pitched as "function + style").

**Observed price point on Etsy:** $55.29+ (below Caryina's intended H2 band but still "premium-coded" inside Etsy search results).

**Scale signals (observable):** 71 shop reviews; 179 sales; "Star Seller"; strong maker-forward copy naming the artisan.

**Positioning (their words):** "handmade from full-grain Italian leather… A solid brass clip… a touch of function and style… Handmade in the Netherlands."

**Evidence links:** Etsy listing plus their own product page (mirrors the positioning).

**Confidence:** Medium (clear craft/story competitor; price sits below Caryina's stated H2 target, but overlaps on "fashionable clip-on leather tech accessory").

---

### YLSecretHeart (Etsy)

**Product type:** H1 competitor set (handmade leather bag charms; includes "Kelly Bag Charms" keywording in at least one charm listing; strong gifting language).

**Observed price point:** the shop's "Leather Flower Charm… Kelly Bag Charms" is shown around ~$76–$77 in Etsy browse results and in the shop's "More from this shop" block — squarely inside Caryina's target competitive band for H1.

**Scale signals (observable):** ~655 shop reviews; ~2.3k shop sales; multi-year Etsy presence; reviews highlight packaging and quality.

**Positioning (their words):** "Leather Flower Charm… Kelly Bag Charms, Leather Gift."

**Evidence links:** Etsy listing context where the price and shop metrics appear.

**Confidence:** Medium–High (pricing and "bag charm as fashion accessory" overlap is strong; aesthetic is not "mini handbag" but competes for the same "bag decoration budget").

---

### TyransLeatherShop (Etsy)

**Product type:** H1 competitor (statement leather flower/orchid bag charms; "wearable art" angle).

**Observed price point:** ~$72.45–$88.73 depending on the orchid charm variant/options.

**Scale signals (observable):** small but premium-leaning shop scale (≈33 reviews; ≈119 sales); "Star Seller" appears on the listing; strong craft/customisation language.

**Positioning (their words):** "premium… handcrafted… piece of wearable art."

**Evidence links:** Etsy orchid bag charm listings.

**Confidence:** Medium (priced right, premium craft framing; lower review count than the "≥50 reviews" ideal for top Etsy competitors, but relevant as an artisan premium entrant).

---

### Sticky Zoo (DTC; social-led)

**Product type:** H1 competitor (bag charms built as "stacked" mini-objects; styling-led; gift-ready packaging).

**Observed price point:** examples show ~€61–€76+ depending on charm ("Baseline Bark Charm" and "Dachshund Sticky Stack Charm").

**Scale signals (observable):** the brand site claims "Instagram (230K)" and "Based on 10,630+ reviews" (site footer / site section).

**Risk signal:** Trustpilot hosts a mixed set of reviews including severe shipping/service complaints and accusations of poor customer service, alongside positive product/packaging reviews.

**Positioning (their words):** "Handcrafted… small-batch… gift-ready… Limited drop; no restocks."

**Evidence links:** product pages + site footer/claims + Trustpilot review page.

**Confidence:** Medium (directly relevant to the "premium charm as fashion object" positioning; DTC claims are self-published and require caution).

---

### String Ting (DTC; fashion press visible)

**Product type:** H1 competitor (beaded "Bag Tings"; maximalist and premium charm economics).

**Observed price point:** the brand's bag charm collection includes £65, £90, £150, and up to £250 listings (examples visible on the collection page).

**Scale signals (observable):** the site claims "55,000+ orders shipped worldwide" and "Loved by 75,000+ since 2020," and positions a "Lifetime re-string guarantee."

**Positioning (their words):** "Hand crafted in London since 2020… Every Ting is strung by hand…"

**Evidence links:** bag charms collection + a representative product page describing craftsmanship and guarantees.

**Confidence:** High as a reference competitor for premium positioning and "charm-as-identity"; Medium as a direct Etsy buyer competitor (DTC channel, higher price ceiling).

---

### MAISON de SABRÉ (DTC; fashion-forward H2 benchmark)

**Product type:** H2 competitor (full-leather AirPods cases; strong colour + personalisation story; adjacent "charm ecosystem" on-site).

**Observed price point:** AirPods case is shown heavily discounted on one product page (AUD $22.50 from AUD $75; "Final Sale"); the brand also sells charm items like the "SABRÉMOJI™" range (AUD $59–$109 shown on the AirPods collection page).

**Scale signals (observable):** one AirPods case page shows "845 Reviews" and a 4.9 rating; Instagram audience is estimated around 492k by an influencer analytics site snapshot (non-official but directionally useful).

**Positioning (their words):** "the world's most luxurious full-leather AirPods Case" and "crafted entirely from full-grain leather."

**Evidence links:** product page + collection narrative + third-party IG estimate.

**Confidence:** Medium (clear premium-fashion framing; exact "normal" prices fluctuate due to aggressive promotions and regional pricing).

---

### Premium entrant and recency note (since Q4 2025)

Several premium-leaning listings in this set are explicitly late-2025 to early-2026 additions (e.g., a SexylittleVintage charm listing is "Listed on Jan 27, 2026"; a YLSecretHeart charm listing is "Listed on 15 Nov, 2025"), indicating that "bag charm" is actively being productised by Etsy sellers, not just DTC brands.

## Section 2 — Indirect and Substitute Options

A Caryina buyer evaluating H1/H2 on Etsy is typically choosing between "make my bag feel new / personal / styled" options — not only between "mini handbag charm vs another mini handbag charm." The main substitute sets at €80–€150 are:

**Bag jewellery and chain charms:** pearl/metal chains and charm stacks that deliver immediate visual impact and luxury signalling, often photographed directly on a "designer-looking" handbag. This is the most visible premium substitute set on Etsy at ~$80–$110+, and it competes directly on "how premium does it look in photos?" even when materials differ from Caryina's leather-look concept.

**Leather "luxury-bag-adjacent" accessories:** vachetta-coded tags, clochettes, tassels, and "designer bag accessory" add-ons (even if not priced at €80–€120, they can steal the purchase because they scratch the same itch: "upgrade the bag"). In Etsy listings, this category often uses "vintage designer" language and shows the accessory on an aspirational tote.

**Fashion-forward tech carry:** for H2 specifically, buyers will compare clip-on AirPods pouches and leather AirPods cases that look "bag-worthy" even if they are not shaped like a micro handbag. The strongest Etsy examples emphasise Italian leather, brass hardware, and gift readiness — often at $69–$99.

Outside Etsy, fashion accessory brands sell AirPods pouches as part of a "mini essentials" ecosystem; for example, Bandolier positions a clip-on AirPods pouch in top-grain leather at $40 (below Caryina's target band but important as a style benchmark).

**The "do nothing" option:** leaving the strap bare is the default; buyers tend to switch once bag charms become a visible social trend or once they want personalisation without buying a new bag. Trend-driven coverage continues to frame bag charms as an accessible way to refresh a bag and express individuality, which is directly relevant to conversion copy and imagery choices.

**Gift-giving alternatives at €80–€150:** the most common comparison basket is (a) small leather goods/tech accessories with personalisation, or (b) "small luxury" jewellery-style pieces. Etsy sellers in the premium charm space explicitly frame items as "gift-ready" and list gifting occasions (graduation, anniversaries, stocking stuffers) inside their title/description blocks — useful directional evidence for Caryina's listing copy structure.

## Section 4 — Observable Strengths and Weaknesses

### SexylittleVintage (Etsy)

**Strengths:** It nails the aspirational handbag owner signal by explicitly anchoring itself in "vintage designer" and sustainability, while offering "handcrafted… bag straps and accessories" as an add-on ecosystem. It also uses "one of the kind" language to justify premium pricing and leans into "vachetta" as a high-intent keyword for entry-tier luxury handbag owners.

**Weaknesses:** The shop is not a single-product artisan brand — its identity is primarily a reseller of designer bags with accessories as an extension. That can create a credibility opening for Caryina's "pure artisan accessory" story (Positano craft, consistent leather/hardware language, tight product world). There is also shipping-friction risk visible in at least one review ("took super long for the item to arrive"), which Caryina can counter by over-communicating dispatch/arrival expectations on Etsy.

### SPECSET (Etsy)

**Strengths:** Premium substitution is strong because the listing looks like fashion jewellery for bags: freshwater pearls + clean product close-ups + lifestyle imagery on a designer-looking purse. The shop also demonstrates operational maturity (hundreds of reviews, thousands of sales) and formalises premium cues via packaging and gift receipts ("wrapped in a… box"; gift receipts).

**Weaknesses:** The most actionable weakness is durability/attachment failure: one buyer review explicitly says the charm is "very delicate" and "broken on my first time trying to attach it to my bag." That is a direct opening for Caryina to differentiate on hardware specification (clip strength, ring thickness, plating, stress points) and to show attachment durability in photos/video.

### TRIMleather (Etsy)

**Strengths:** The product reads "real leather + good metal" through materials language: "full-grain… Italian cowhide" and "sturdy brass clasp," and the shop-level scale implies repeat buyers (review text: "my go to for all my Apple product… for more than a decade"). This is a powerful trust moat for H2.

**Weaknesses:** The aesthetic is fundamentally functional minimalism rather than fashion-first. For Caryina H2, that is an opening: make the case look like a "bag accessory" first (structured silhouette, gold hardware that matches handbag hardware, editorial photography), while still matching the functional proof points TRIMleather communicates (fit, protection, attachment).

### PEGAI (Etsy)

**Strengths:** Massive Etsy scale (18.7k reviews; 107k sales) plus extremely "giftable" copy blocks (graduation/anniversary/travel tech gift) and strong feature framing (full-grain hides claim, suede lining, magnetic closure, keychain attachment). This is the most dangerous Etsy competitor for H2 due to social proof and polish.

**Weaknesses:** The listing itself contains a major geographic constraint ("U.S. shipping only" and does not ship to the UK), which can reduce competitive pressure in EU-focused testing and also creates an opening for Caryina to win EU buyers looking for premium leather tech accessories with simpler shipping. Additionally, PEGAI's attempt to be "premium but not premium price" may be a positioning mismatch versus Caryina's "premium artisan" story — Caryina can justify higher price-per-unit by being more fashion-object and more Italy/Positano-coded.

### Sticky Zoo (DTC benchmark)

**Strengths:** Extremely strong fashion merchandising: "stackable" charms, limited drops, and gift-ready packaging cues. The site explicitly surfaces social proof ("Based on 10,630+ reviews") and even publishes social audience numbers in the footer (Instagram 230K), which function as high-status cues.

**Weaknesses:** Independent consumer reviews show reputational risk around shipping, returns, and customer service, including severe negative experiences (alongside positive ones). For Caryina, that reinforces a strategic opportunity: pair premium imagery with high-operational trust signals (clear processing times, proactive shipping updates, EU-friendly returns), especially for an Etsy-first test where "Etsy trust" and shop responsiveness matter.

---

### Etsy listing/SEO note (what the best sellers are optimising for)

Across the strongest Etsy competitors above, titles/descriptions behave like keyword blocks, combining: product form ("bag charm", "purse charm", "AirPods case"), material ("genuine leather", "full grain", "Italian leather", "vachetta"), attachment ("clip", "keychain"), and gifting occasions. Etsy itself has continued to update title guidance and provides tools to help sellers align with updated listing-title rules — meaning Caryina should treat "SEO title hygiene" as a first-order variable in the 90-day test, not an afterthought.

---

## Section 5 — Open Questions and Confidence Tags

- **Assumption:** Caryina can sustain a €95–€120 price on Etsy if photography and hardware detail make the charm look like a "fashion object" rather than "craft accessory." This is inferred from the observed willingness to pay ~$100+ for bag jewellery charms (pearls) and ~$99 for premium leather/texture AirPods cases on Etsy, but it is not a direct proof of price elasticity for mini handbag-shaped charms.

- **Unverified:** The true "top ranking" Etsy keywords/tags used by competitors (Etsy does not expose full tag sets publicly on listings in a consistently readable way). This report relies on observable title/description language and repeated keyword motifs rather than definitive tag exports.

- **Gap:** Reliable "monthly sales velocity" per listing (Etsy does not provide per-listing sales counts; only indirect proxies like shop review volume, shop sales totals, "low in stock," "views last 24 hours," and scattered review timestamps). Without third-party estimator tools or internal purchase tests, velocity comparisons remain approximate.

- **Unverified:** Social following for several Etsy-native competitors (most Etsy listings do not reliably publish social links/follower numbers). For DTC brands, social numbers may be self-published (Sticky Zoo) or third-party estimates (MAISON de SABRÉ), both of which can be directionally useful but are not audited.
