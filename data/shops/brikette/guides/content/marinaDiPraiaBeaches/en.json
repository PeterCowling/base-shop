        "Unlike Spiaggia Grande or Fornillo, Marina di Praia sits in a narrow gorge just outside Praiano. The cliffs block a lot of swell, so the water often feels calmer than exposed beaches.",
        "The tradeoff is space. The beach is small, so arrive early if you want the free strip near the water. If you arrive later, plan on a drink or lunch and take whatever spot opens up.",
        "In summer, the best sun is around midday. Shade arrives as the cliffs block the light, which can feel great on hot days (but cool if it’s windy)."

        "The journey takes about 20 minutes. You'll wind along the coastal road with great views - sit on the sea side if you can. The driver will usually announce Marina di Praia, but keep an eye out for the signed stop after you pass through the main part of Praiano.",
        "Get off at the signed stop between Praiano and Furore and follow the stone path downhill for two minutes. The walk is short and paved the whole way. You'll pass a few small shops and cafes before reaching the beach level.",
        "For the return, wait at the same stop on the opposite side. Check the posted timetable when you arrive and aim for an earlier bus if you have dinner plans. Buses can fill up in summer, so don't wait for the absolute last service - give yourself a backup option.",
        "If you miss the bus or it's full, you can walk up to the main road and flag down the next one, or share a taxi back to Positano (around €35-€45 split between 3-4 people). Review our %LINK:sitaTickets|SITA bus guide% if you want a quick refresher on tickets and validation."

        "The last SITA buses towards Positano vary by month but typically run until around 21:30 in summer. Check the posted timetable when you arrive and aim for the second-to-last service in case one is full. After the final bus, taxis from Praiano to Positano cost €35–€45, so split with travel mates if you linger longer."

The lido loungers are more secure since staff are around, but still avoid leaving phones and wallets unattended. Your safest bet is to leave valuables in your hostel locker before you come."
