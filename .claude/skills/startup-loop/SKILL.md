# Startup Loop

Operate the Startup Loop through a single chat command surface. This skill is an operator wrapper. It does not replace the DO processes (`/lp-do-fact-find`, `/lp-do-plan`, `/lp-do-build`).

## Operating Mode

**ORCHESTRATE + GATE + HANDOFF**

Allowed:
- Read canonical Startup Loop docs and current business artifacts.
- Determine current stage and gate status.
- Hand user exact prompt files and output paths when input/research is missing.
- Validate submitted artifact path and stage fit.
- Enforce Business OS sync actions before stage advance.

Not allowed:
- Silent stage skipping.
- Advancing while required artifacts or BOS sync actions are incomplete.
- Treating markdown mirrors of cards/ideas as source of truth.

## Invocation

- `/startup-loop start --business <BIZ> --mode <dry|live> --launch-surface <pre-website|website-live> [--start-point <problem|product>]`
  - `--start-point` is optional. Default is `product`. Existing runs that omit this flag are unaffected.
- `/startup-loop status --business <BIZ>`
- `/startup-loop submit --business <BIZ> --stage <STAGE_ID> --artifact <path>`
- `/startup-loop advance --business <BIZ>`

**Business resolution pre-flight:** If `--business` is absent or the directory `docs/business-os/strategy/<BIZ>/` does not exist, apply `_shared/business-resolution.md` before any other step.

## Command Module Routing

Load the relevant module per command:

| Command | Module |
|---|---|
| `start` | `modules/cmd-start.md` |
| `status` | `modules/cmd-status.md` |
| `submit` | `modules/cmd-submit.md` |
| `advance` | `modules/cmd-advance.md` |

**Internal modules** (called automatically — not operator-invocable):

| Module | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `modules/assessment-intake-sync.md` | Called by `cmd-start` and `cmd-advance` as part of ASSESSMENT-09 Intake contract validation (`GATE-ASSESSMENT-00`). Writes or refreshes `<BIZ>-intake-packet.user.md` from ASSESSMENT-01–ASSESSMENT-08 precursors. No-op when precursors are unchanged. |

## Required Output Contract

For `start`, `status`, and `advance`, return this exact packet:

```text
run_id: SFS-<BIZ>-<YYYYMMDD>-<hhmm>
business: <BIZ>
loop_spec_version: 3.12.0
current_stage: <STAGE_ID>
current_stage_label: <label_operator_short for current_stage>
current_stage_display: <label_operator_long for current_stage>
next_stage_label: <label_operator_short for next eligible stage or null>
next_stage_display: <label_operator_long for next eligible stage or null>
status: <ready|blocked|awaiting-input|complete>
blocking_reason: <none or exact reason>
next_action: <single sentence command/action>
prompt_file: <path or none>
required_output_path: <path or none>
naming_gate: <null>  # deprecated field; retained for backwards-compat
bos_sync_actions:
  - <required sync action 1>
  - <required sync action 2>
```

## Stage Addressing

| Flag | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `--stage <ID>` | Canonical stage ID. Case-insensitive. Always primary. Legacy IDs `S3` and `S10` are accepted and remapped to map-canonical IDs (`SIGNALS-01`, `SIGNALS`) for compatibility. |
| `--stage-alias <slug>` | Deterministic slug from `stage-operator-map.json` alias_index. Fail-closed on unknown. |
| `--stage-label <text>` | Exact match against `label_operator_short` or `label_operator_long`. Case-sensitive. Fail-closed on near-match. |

Resolver: `scripts/src/startup-loop/stage-addressing.ts`
Canonical alias source: `docs/business-os/startup-loop/_generated/stage-operator-map.json`

When a stage reference cannot be resolved, return fail-closed with deterministic suggestions. Do not infer or guess stage IDs from near-matches.

## Stage Model

Canonical source: `docs/business-os/startup-loop/loop-spec.yaml` (spec_version 3.12.0).
Stage labels: `docs/business-os/startup-loop/_generated/stage-operator-map.json`.

## Global Invariants

- Never allow silent stage skipping.
- BOS sync must be confirmed complete before advance for all non-DO stages. See `modules/cmd-advance.md` for sync contract.
- Canonical source of truth is always `loop-spec.yaml` — not markdown mirrors of cards or ideas.
- All stage references are resolved via stage-addressing.ts — never guess stage IDs.
