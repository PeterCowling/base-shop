  "intro": [
    "Bagni della Regina Giovanna is a collapsed sea cave on the Sorrento peninsula where clear water flows into a sheltered natural pool. There are no beach clubs or snack bars here — just limestone cliffs, emerald shallows, and a natural arch that makes the water glow on sunny mornings.",
    "This guide is written for hostel guests. If you want the exact step-by-step route from Positano (tickets, transfer points, and the final downhill lane), start with %LINK:hostelBriketteToReginaGiovannaBath|Hostel Brikette → Bagni della Regina Giovanna directions% and come back here for the “what it’s like” part.",
    "Plan it as a two-stage day: swim early while the ledges are quiet, then return to Sorrento for lunch and a wander before heading back on the %LINK:sorrentoPositanoBus|Sorrento → Positano bus% (or the %LINK:sorrentoPositanoFerry|Sorrento → Positano ferry% when seas are calm)."

        "The Roman villa ruins above the pool frame turquoise water that funnels in from the sea through a natural arch. When the sea is calm, the pool stays sheltered even if the open coast looks choppy — it feels like a secret swimming “room” carved into the limestone.",
        "Unlike Positano’s lidos, this spot is free year-round. That freedom comes with trade-offs: no shade rentals, no toilets, no lifeguards, and a rocky access route. If you pack smart, it’s one of the most memorable swims you can do near Sorrento without booking a boat.",
        "From the hostel, our staff recommend treating it like a sunrise-or-early-morning mission. The ledges are narrow, and once groups arrive, it stops being relaxing. Get in, swim, take your photos, then leave before the midday heat turns the climb back up into a punishment."

        "Once you are on Via Capo, you are looking for signage that says “Bagni della Regina Giovanna”. The downhill lane is paved at first, then becomes a rougher path as you approach the ruins. Allow around 10 minutes to reach the villa area and another five to descend the stone steps into the cove.",
        "Brikette staff tip: screenshot your return options before you drop down to the water. Mobile signal can be patchy by the rocks, and you don’t want to be guessing your way back at sunset.",

        "If you only remember one thing: go early. The “beach” here is not a wide stretch of sand — it’s rock ledges. When a few groups arrive, it gets crowded fast, and it becomes harder to find a safe entry point into the water.",
        "Season matters. In shoulder season, the water can be cold and the steps can stay damp; in mid-summer, the heat on the rocks is intense and shade is limited. Either way, stable weather makes the experience better: after storms the access route can be slippery with algae and debris.",
        "A simple Brikette day plan: leave after breakfast, arrive for a morning swim, then head back to Sorrento for lunch and a walk. If you want a “big views” add-on, finish the day at a viewpoint or a waterfront aperitivo — and keep your return route in mind via %LINK:sorrentoPositanoBus|bus% or %LINK:sorrentoPositanoFerry|ferry%."
