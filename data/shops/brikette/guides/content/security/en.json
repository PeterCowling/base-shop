Lockers and safe boxes are provided where available; using them is simple but does not shift liability to the hostel, so we recommend keeping your travel-insurance up to date. For everyone’s peace of mind, keep room doors shut and secure the locker provided—items. Items left behind for more than 30 days will be donated, recycled, or disposed of."

If your band is lost or damaged, let reception know—there is a small replacement fee. Guests who are not wearing a wristband or who decline to show ID may be asked to leave, and refunds may not be possible."

If an unregistered person is found staying in a room, the registered guest(s) will be charged the standard room rate for that person plus an administrative fee equal to twice that amount. The additional guest must complete check-in immediately or depart; if they decline, the hostel is obliged to contact the local authorities. Not declaring an overnight guest may also result in the booking being recorded as a No-Show."
