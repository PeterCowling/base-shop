# MARKET-05 assumptions and risk register for Caryina

This is a structured synthesis of MARKET-01 through MARKET-04 (no new primary research). It converts the consolidated findings into a decision tool: explicit assumptions, falsifiable "kill tests" for the first 30 days, a risk register with mitigations, and a "ready-for-offer" checklist to unblock MARKET-06.

Two definitions used throughout:

- **Kill test** = an observable signal inside the first 30 days that would falsify (or strongly weaken) an assumption and therefore trigger a design or channel change, not "more waiting".
- **Baseline falsifiable success criterion** = ≥3 paid orders within 28 days at the launch prices, with listing execution that meets Etsy's own minimum search-quality requirements (photo, policies, category, etc.).

---

## Section 1 — Top Assumptions

| Category | Assumption statement | Dependency | Source stage | Confidence | Kill test for Day 30 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Demand | Bag charms have enough runway in 2026 to support a new artisan entrant for a 90-day Etsy test (trend is maturing but still active). | Proceed now (do not wait for a new season to test). | MARKET-02 | Medium | If H1 listings with correct Etsy listing quality (high-res photos, return policy, correct category) receive meaningful impressions but negligible favourites/carts and social content about bag charm styling shows no engagement lift at all, treat as "trend cooling in-channel" and pivot positioning hard into gifting + craftsmanship (or pause). |
| Demand | Buyers are actively searching for bag charms on Etsy, but trust is fragile due to reseller noise (opening for credible origin proof). | Invest in origin/craft proof rather than competing on price. | MARKET-02 | High | If buyer messages/comments repeatedly ask "is this AliExpress / dropship?" or show disbelief about origin/quality, treat as missing proof assets and fix before scaling traffic. |
| Demand | There is latent demand for a handbag-silhouette micro-bag charm specifically at €99 (the gap observed is not purely "nobody wants this"). | Whether H1 is worth testing at premium price rather than resigning to €30–€60. | MARKET-01 + MARKET-03 | Medium–Low | If the listing gets impressions + favourites but messages/reviews repeatedly benchmark the silhouette against $10–$30 mini purse charms ("this should be $20"), treat as failed price discovery due to category anchoring and move to a structured price/framing test (not "hope"). |
| Demand | H1 is visually distinctive enough on Etsy to resist the sub-$30 anchor effect. | Hold €99 without immediately discounting. | MARKET-01 | Medium | If thumbnail-level browsing drives low CTR/engagement (views occur but almost no favourites/carts) and qualitative feedback suggests "looks like the $11 version," treat as "visual sameness" and redo hero image direction before changing price. |
| Price | €99 (H1) can convert on Etsy within 28 days if the listing reads "premium object," even though a performance density exists around ~$79. | Finalise H1 launch price and build the listing strategy around premium signalling. | MARKET-03 | Medium | If H1 produces <3 paid orders by Day 28 despite consistent traffic and strong intent signals (favourites, carts), treat price as too high or proof as insufficient; run a controlled price step (e.g., €99 → €89) or bundle incentive, not open-ended discounting. |
| Price | €89 (H2) can convert only if framed as a fashion accessory (micro-bag charm) rather than a tech cover, because Etsy AirPods cases are heavily commoditised. | Whether H2 should be standalone, bundle-only, or deferred. | MARKET-02 + MARKET-03 | Medium–Low | If H2 gets views but almost no purchases and buyer messages say "too expensive for an AirPods case," treat this as a framing/price ceiling signal and run a two-frame test (micro-bag charm vs "AirPods case") and/or bundle H2 with H1 as the default path. |
| Price | Caryina can launch without discounting and still convert (premium proof compensates for lack of "sale" cues common on Etsy). | Preserve premium positioning and avoid self-anchoring at a lower "sale price." | MARKET-03 | Medium | If conversion is near-zero but comparable listings in adjacent sets show persistent markdown-based buying behaviour, test a non-price offer first (e.g., free monogram hardware tag, free gift wrap) before discounting MSRP. |
| Channel | Etsy organic provides enough initial impressions for a new shop via recency testing (hours to days). | Whether the first 28 days generate enough data to be meaningful without paid acquisition. | MARKET-04 | High | If new listings remain near-zero impressions after the recency window and Etsy's search visibility requirements (photo, return policy, category) are met, treat it as setup/SEO/indexing failure and pause launch iteration until fixed (do not waste the 28-day clock). |
| Channel | TikTok + Instagram organic can create measurable Etsy search lift within 30 days. | Whether social content is worth the operator time in the demand test. | MARKET-04 | Medium | If you publish a minimum viable cadence (e.g., 8–12 short-form posts) but Etsy shows no correlated lift (direct visits, brand-search queries, favourites), treat it as format mismatch and pivot content formats immediately (not "post more"). |
| Channel | US buyers will still convert despite the Feb 2026 de minimis duty change—or EU/UK buyers will supply enough demand signal to validate without the US. | Whether the test can include US from Day 1 without hurting reviews and data integrity. | MARKET-04 | Medium–Low | If early US orders trigger duty surprise complaints/cancellations/cases (especially damaging for a zero-review shop), treat US as a risk-heavy segment and re-scope the test to EU/UK until a minimal review buffer exists. |
| Operations | Etsy onboarding for an Italy-based seller can be completed fast enough to hit the planned launch window (identity, bank, tax/DAC7/VAT steps). | Whether "launch date" planning is realistic. | MARKET-04 | Medium | If seller verification or bank verification enters limbo (or risks suspension windows), treat this as a launch blocker and shift the timeline rather than rushing suboptimal listings. |
| Operations | Shipping from Italy can be priced into "free shipping" and still be viable at €99/€89, despite high postal tariffs and long delivery times. | Whether US "free shipping" is feasible or whether the test must be EU-led. | MARKET-03 + MARKET-04 | Medium | If real outbound shipping costs and delivery times produce buyer friction (late delivery complaints, cancellations) or destroy viability, treat as a scope issue: tighten geographies, change carrier/service, or re-architect "free shipping" rather than silently absorbing losses. |
| Product | Photography + craft-proof assets can be produced so the listing "reads €99" to cold Etsy browsers (high-res, clear product, premium cues). | Whether the Etsy test is valid (testing demand vs testing weak creative). | MARKET-03 | Medium–Low until tested | If a lightweight perception check shows that viewers anchor the product under €50 (or "cheap Etsy"), treat this as a hard creative blocker before running a 28-day price-demand test. |
| Product | H1/H2 are functionally viable (clip durability, scratch prevention, correct AirPods fit), avoiding early returns/negative reviews in a new shop. | Early shop reputation (reviews/cases) and thus future visibility. | MARKET-03 | Medium | If the first few orders generate repeated complaints about attachment failure, scratching, or fit, treat as product readiness failure and pause scaling until the defect is resolved. |

## Section 2 — Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Source stage | Mitigation action | Blocking? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R‑1a Bag charm trend declines faster than expected, shrinking demand during the validation window. | Medium | Medium | MARKET-02 | Shift away from novelty into "refined/craft/texture-led" execution in creative; emphasise gifting and "bag refresh without buying a new bag." | No |
| R‑1b Sub‑$30 mini purse lookalikes prevent price discovery; buyers assume €99 is mispriced. | High | High | MARKET-01 + 03 | Hero image direction must clearly differentiate (materials close-ups, hardware detail, on-bag lifestyle); avoid thumbnails that resemble $11–$20 listings. | No (but can invalidate the test if ignored) |
| R‑2a €99 H1 fails to convert (no ≥3 paid orders by Day 28). | High | Medium | MARKET-03 | Predefine a price step plan (e.g., hold €99 for 28 days; contingency €89 test) and keep all other variables fixed during the price test. | No |
| R‑2b €89 H2 fails because Etsy buyers are conditioned to $20–$50 AirPods cases (commoditised category). | Medium | High | MARKET-02 + 03 | Frame as "micro-bag charm that holds AirPods"; bias H2 as an add-on or bundle; avoid "AirPods case" commodity SEO-only framing. | No |
| R‑2c Offsite Ads attribution compresses margin with a 15% fee on attributed orders under $10k annual shop sales. | Medium | Medium | MARKET-04 | Decide intentionally: opt out if eligible, or stay in but monitor attribution rate and treat it as a cost of customer acquisition. Etsy policy indicates opt-out is possible below the $10k threshold. | No |
| R‑3a US duties after de minimis suspension create surprise charges, delays, complaints, and negative reviews. | High | High | MARKET-04 | Add duty disclosure language; choose trackable services; consider EU/UK-first validation to build review buffer before US scaling. | No (but can seriously damage a new shop) |
| R‑3b Etsy Italy seller onboarding delays launch (identity, bank, tax/DAC7). | High | Medium | MARKET-04 | Start onboarding immediately; prepare documents; treat verification completion as a hard gate for launch planning. | Yes |
| R‑3c Shipping costs/time make "free shipping" economically or reputationally unviable at €99/€89. | High | Medium | MARKET-03 + 04 | Re-scope geographies; choose service level that matches buyer expectations; keep delivery promises conservative. | Yes if "US free shipping" is a core design requirement; otherwise No |
| R‑3d Social cadence collapses mid-test; discovery channel goes dark. | Medium | Medium | MARKET-04 | Reduce scope: pick one primary social platform; pre-batch posts; use 2–3 repeatable formats. | No |
| R‑4a Photography fails the "reads €99" threshold and confounds the test. | High | Medium | MARKET-03 | Treat the photography perception check as a launch gate; meet Etsy's own listing photo recommendations (e.g., clear, well-lit, high-res). | Yes |
| R‑4b Hardware/clip durability issues trigger returns and early negative reviews. | High | Medium | MARKET-03 | Stress-test attachment; improve packaging to prevent scratches; ensure messaging sets correct expectations; keep early batch small until confirmed. | Potentially (depends on severity) |
| R‑5a Etsy search dynamics change during the test (algorithm or visibility tooling updates). | Medium | Low–Medium | MARKET-04 | Traffic redundancy: strengthen social + Pinterest; keep listings compliant and complete so you retain baseline visibility. | No |
| R‑5b TikTok regulatory disruption removes a key discovery lever in a priority market. | Medium | Low–Medium | MARKET-04 | Ensure redundancy across Instagram + Pinterest and Etsy SEO; avoid single-channel dependency. | No |

## Section 3 — Evidence Conflicts and Required Resolution Artifacts

| Conflict | Stage sources in conflict | Required resolution artifact | Decision impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| H2 pricing is explicitly medium–low confidence: €89 depends on fashion-object framing, but the category is demonstrably price-conditioned. | MARKET-02 vs MARKET-03 | A 14–28 day two-frame test: (a) "micro-bag charm that holds AirPods" vs (b) "AirPods case," keeping photography constant; optionally test €89 vs €79 with all else fixed. | Whether H2 is standalone, bundle-only, or deferred. |
| Offsite Ads constraint needs clarification: "applies from day 1 and cannot opt out" vs Etsy's documented opt-out below $10k. | MARKET-04 synthesis vs Etsy policy | Screenshot / written record of the shop's Offsite Ads setting after onboarding: opt out if eligible; document the operational default. | Margin risk control and early unit economics for attributed orders. |
| Demand evidence gaps (exact Google Trends, TikTok hashtag volumes, Etsy autocomplete) were not captured. | MARKET-02 gaps | Treat as tolerable: the demand test's primary truth source is Etsy impressions/search terms/favourites post-launch; capture query terms and engagement as "channel-native demand evidence." | Narrative confidence only; not a launch blocker. |
| Positano consignment split (40–60% store share) is low-confidence and non-localised. | MARKET-04 | 2–3 written terms from local boutiques/hosts: commission %, payout cadence, shrinkage handling, minimum stock, merchandising requirements. | Tourist channel feasibility; not core to Etsy validation. |
| Photography proof gate (TASK‑06) is critical but not yet completed. | MARKET-03 + MARKET-04 | A fast perception check with the hero image + 3 supporting images: expected price, "would buy at €99?", perceived quality vs "cheap Etsy". | Blocks a valid price-demand test if not resolved. |

## Section 4 — Decision-Critical Unknowns to Resolve Before Offer Finalisation

### Blocking unknowns (must resolve before listing launch)

| Unknown | Blocking? | Resolution path | Deadline |
|---|---|---|---|
| Etsy shop activation for Italy seller: identity verification, seller info verification, payments/bank payout verification. | Yes | Complete onboarding on desktop, enable 2FA, submit seller verification docs if requested, verify bank deposit amount or upload statement as required. | Before launch |
| Listing quality meets "reads €99" threshold and Etsy minimum search-quality requirements. | Yes | Run the perception check; if it fails, reshoot (macro texture, hardware, on-bag scale, packaging) until it passes. | Before launch |
| Shipping architecture: enabled geographies (EU/UK/US), carrier/service choice, and duty/disruption disclosure text (especially US). | Yes | Decide market scope; write duty note; choose trackable carrier/service and set processing times conservatively. | Before launch |
| Product QA: clip durability, scratch prevention, packaging protection, AirPods fit. | Yes | Stress-test the first small batch; photograph fit/attachment; include protective wrap instructions; keep initial inventory lean until confirmed. | Before launch |

### Non-blocking unknowns (can resolve during the test)

| Unknown | Blocking? | Resolution path | Deadline |
|---|---|---|---|
| Whether TikTok Shop is worth enabling for an Italy-based seller in the test window. | No | Defer until Day 60; only evaluate after organic discovery is repeatable; confirm operational overhead (returns expectations). | By Day 60 |
| POS tourist channel economics for June–Sept (consignment %, who handles sales, payout cadence). | No | Start outreach by Day 60; request written terms; test with minimal inventory and strict stock control. | By Day 90 (ahead of June) |
| Pinterest setup value for Etsy listings. | No | Add product pins linking to Etsy listings; measure outbound clicks and saves after 30 days. | By Day 30 |
| The exact sensitivity of demand to discounting vs premium proof. | No | Hold list price initially; use controlled, limited experiments (gift wrap, free upgrade) before changing MSRP. | By Day 30 |

## Section 5 — Ready-for-Offer Checklist

| Check | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Competitor set mapped with pricing and review evidence | ✅ Complete | Enough to anchor the €60–€150 band and highlight the sub-$30 silhouette anchoring risk. |
| Demand evidence for primary ICP is sufficient to support offer hypothesis | ⚠️ Gap (non-blocking) | Trend is active but maturing; channel-native intent exists, but "handbag-silhouette at €99" remains the core uncertainty to test. |
| Price hypothesis is validated to Medium confidence or better for at least H1 | ✅ Complete | H1 €99 marked Medium confidence in MARKET-03; still requires creative proof gate to be meaningful. |
| Price hypothesis for H2 is understood with explicit confidence tag | ✅ Complete | H2 €89 is Medium–Low confidence due to strong commoditisation signal; requires framing/bundle strategy and/or structured test. |
| Primary channel (Etsy) is operationally feasible for Italy-based seller | ⚠️ Gap (launch-dependent) | Feasible, but verification gates and bank/tax compliance are real launch blockers until completed. |
| Discovery channels (TikTok/Instagram) are identified and executable | ✅ Complete | Channel fit evidenced; execution depends on sustained cadence and repeatable formats. |
| Key risks are documented and mitigations identified | ✅ Complete | Risk register provides mitigations and explicit blockers. |
| Blocking unknowns are listed with resolution paths | ✅ Complete | Shop verification + photography gate + shipping architecture are the critical pre-launch items. |
| Falsifiable success criterion (≥3 paid orders in 28 days) is aligned with evidence base | ✅ Complete | Etsy recency/testing window and listing-quality requirements make a 28-day test meaningful if the blockers are cleared. |

## MARKET-05 Conclusion

MARKET-05 is complete; MARKET-06 is unblocked only once three practical blockers are cleared:

1. **Etsy Italy seller verification and bank payout setup** — start onboarding immediately; treat completion as a hard gate
2. **Photography/proof assets passing a "reads €99" perception gate** — do not start the 28-day clock until this passes
3. **Shipping + duties disclosure architecture** — especially for the US under the Feb 2026 de minimis change; decide geographies before listing
