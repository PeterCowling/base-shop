## Core Problem

Fashion-conscious women who already own premium handbags (designer or "premium high-street") want artisan-quality, aesthetically distinctive bag accessories (bag charms, AirPod holders, small pouches / mini-SLGs) that feel premium-but-accessible (target: €80–€150) and come with a credible brand/story.

In most markets they face a forced choice:

- **Mass-market options (€5–€35)** that look disposable, generic, or "cheap" — low craftsmanship, low story value, or
- **Luxury-house options (€300–€1,500+)** that are priced and distributed as luxury signalling goods, often boutique-gated, relationship-gated, and in limited supply.

Separately, luxury-destination visitors (e.g., Amalfi Coast) who want a place-specific, wearable premium souvenir face the same binary: mass-produced trinkets or unbranded leather goods with weak provenance and no recognisable "story container."

## Affected User Groups

### Group 1 — The handbag personaliser (primary)

Women ~27–42, fashion-aware, who own one or more bags at the LV/Gucci entry tier and above (~€600–€1,500 bag ownership). Motivations:

- Personal expression — making a widely-owned style feel "unmistakably mine"
- Craft appreciation — wanting something that looks made with real skill, not printed in China
- Playful self-expression against a serious/investment bag
- Quality that "reads real" in hand and in photos

*Segmentation note: The Coach/MK tier buyer (€300–€800 bags) purchases charms as "cute affordable personalisation," not craft-premium items. The LV/Gucci-tier buyer (~€600+) is the segment that will find €80–€150 plausible if the material story is legible. Confirmed by tier analysis (Bloomberg/BoF, JOOR 2025); see research appendix section A1.*

### Group 2 — The luxury-destination tourist (seasonal, secondary)

International visitors to the Amalfi Coast with high daily spend ($391–$1,098/person/day, True Luxury Travels 2024) and a short purchase window (1–3 days). Motivations:

- A souvenir that is wearable and giftable — not decorative clutter
- Place prestige + artisan credibility
- Low time for research; needs fast trust signals in-store

*2.3M overnight stays/year on Amalfi Coast (2024 record, Statista). Fashion/accessories = 12.2% of in-destination spend for international Italy visitors. Claimed-by-sources — evidence captures not yet filed in evidence pack.*

### Group 3 — Premium gift buyer (tertiary)

Gift purchasers in the €80–€150 bracket who want "special + story-worthy" without the complexity of luxury-house access. Motivations:

- A gift that looks considered and expensive relative to price
- Packaging and story does a lot of work
- Reduced wrong-buy risk (compatibility and style clarity needed)

## Severity and Frequency

**Severity:**
- HIGH for Groups 1 and 3: a structural price + access gap blocks the "sweet spot" purchase they want to make. The €80–€150 artisan tier is sparse — Coach anchors at ~€95, next coherent branded tier is €300+ (Loewe, Miu Miu).
- MEDIUM for Group 2: the failure mode is a missed purchase, not daily frustration — still meaningful because the spend intent exists within the visit window.

**Frequency:**
- Discovery frequency for Group 1 is HIGH: "bag charm ideas" searches grew 10,000%+ May 2024–May 2025 (Accio trend data). TikTok/Instagram surfaces the category continuously; purchase triggers in order: trend exposure → new bag acquisition → gifting → collectibility (see research appendix B1).
- Purchase deliberation window: the LV/Gucci-tier buyer deliberates 3–7 days online before purchasing at €80–€150. This is not an impulse buy at this price point.
- Group 2 is once-per-visit, concentrated in peak season (June–September).

## Current Workarounds (and why they don't satisfy)

| Workaround | Wins | Loses | Failure state avoided |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fast fashion / mass-market (€5–€35) | Availability, price | Perceived craft, uniqueness, longevity, story | Doesn't solve "reads premium in hand" |
| Luxury houses (€300–€1,500+) | Brand signalling, status | Price accessibility, distribution gating | Solves quality but not accessibility |
| "Bag-on-a-bag" / mini-bag charms (Miu Miu, Loewe €800+) | Category aesthetic | Pushes buyer back into luxury-tier barriers | Category desire met; price barrier unchanged |
| Etsy / fragmented artisan sellers | Access, variety | Dropship/mass (story gap) or true handmade with weak brand (trust + premium scaling gap) | Quality varies; buyer can't be sure |
| Do nothing | — | Unmet demand remains latent | — |

**Documented buyer failure states (PurseForum, PurseBlog, Alibaba buyer guides):**
1. **Looks/feels cheap or plasticky** — "cheap plating scrubs off," "sharp edges or uneven plating" are disqualifying signals. Even designer charms fail this test.
2. **Damages the bag** — clip/attachment hardware that scratches a €1,000 bag is a fatal product flaw; buyers cite this explicitly in forum discussions.
3. **Looks tacky or overdone** — a segment worries about "trying too hard." Opening for "one considered charm that elevates" vs. the maximalist pile-on.
4. **Photographs poorly** (inferred) — purchase discovery is TikTok/IG-driven; a charm that doesn't photograph beautifully is invisible in the discovery channel.
5. **Breaks quickly** — hardware and plating durability cited across buyer guides and forum discussions.

## Problem Boundary

**In-scope:**
- Original-branded artisan accessories (not logo copying)
- Accessories designed to complement premium bags without implying brand affiliation
- Place-specific capsule SKUs for Amalfi / Positano with genuine provenance and story

**Out-of-scope / risk zones:**
- Any product that copies luxury-house trademarks, hardware signatures, or protected patterns
- Messaging that implies official association with luxury houses
- Use of the term "Birkin" in any public-facing materials — a 2025 Paris Judicial Court decision confirms that iconic bag designs and related 3D marks are enforceable in Europe, including against lookalike products (not only logo copies). IP counsel review required before wholesale or institutional channel launch. See research appendix section J.

## Kill Condition

**PASS — with provisional qualifications on three failure modes:**

**1. Market too small → PASS (provisional)**
Global DTC market for bag accessories exists and is growing (JOOR 12× wholesale signal). Destination retail in Positano is additive and seasonal. Provisional because a realistic CAC → conversion model has not been built. Unblocked by: running proof tests (questions in research appendix I) that establish actual conversion economics.

**2. Solved by incumbents → PASS**
Full competitor audit (10 verified brands at €50–€250) confirms the artisan-Italian-provenance position at €100–€160 is unoccupied. No funded incumbent combines AirPod Pro engineering + Italian artisan provenance + bag charm identity under €250. Destination retail as a distribution channel is entirely unoccupied by any competitor in this category. Detail in research appendix H and forward-propagated to DISCOVERY-02/DISCOVERY-03.

**3. Insufficient willingness to pay → PASS (provisional)**
High-end spend (Hermès $930, Chanel $950 AirPod cases; Loewe/Miu Miu €300–€1,990 bag charms) proves category desire exists. Your €80–€150 tier needs direct validation via conversion tests (preorders, pop-up, ads-to-waitlist). Unblocked by: proof tests measuring purchase behaviour at target price point.

**Verdict: GO — proceed to DISCOVERY-02 (solution-space scan). Run proof tests that convert (a) trend evidence into (b) purchase evidence at target price point, with measured CAC and conversion before committing supply chain investment.**
