# Product Pipeline — Business Plan

## Strategy

### Current Focus (2026-02-09)

1. **L1 Foundation: Validate Fulfillment Path** (Priority: High)
   - Status: ZERO revenue, no Amazon seller account, no fulfillment validated, no payment processing
   - Next: Validate end-to-end fulfillment (China sourcing → EU warehouse → customer) before building infrastructure

2. **Catalog Architecture** (Priority: Medium)
   - Status: PIPE-ENG-0001 (catalog/stock/media) planned; no product data model exists
   - Next: Design catalog schema supporting multi-channel (Amazon, own site, configurator) and variant management

3. **First Product Validation** (Priority: High)
   - Status: PIPE-ENG-0003 (Handbag Configurator) planned as first SKU test
   - Next: Validate single product end-to-end (sourcing, margins, shipping, customs) before scaling

## Risks

### Active Risks

- **No Revenue Validation** (Severity: High, Added: 2026-02-09)
  - Source: ZERO revenue, no Amazon seller account, no proven fulfillment chain
  - Impact: Building infrastructure without market validation; capital at risk
  - Mitigation: Validate single product fulfillment and first sale before infrastructure investment; consider manual fulfillment for MVP

- **Multi-Channel Complexity** (Severity: Medium, Added: 2026-02-09)
  - Source: Cards planned for Edge Commerce (PIPE-ENG-0002), Handbag Configurator (PIPE-ENG-0003), and XA Client (PIPE-ENG-0004) before L1 complete
  - Impact: Premature complexity; maintenance burden before product-market fit
  - Mitigation: Sequence work: fulfillment validation → single channel → multi-channel expansion

- **Customs & Compliance Unknowns** (Severity: High, Added: 2026-02-09)
  - Source: China → EU import duties, VAT, product compliance (CE marking, REACH, etc.) not validated
  - Impact: Margin erosion, legal risk, fulfillment delays
  - Mitigation: Consult customs broker, validate compliance requirements before first shipment

## Metrics

### Revenue (Established: 2026-02-09)

- **Monthly Revenue:** $0 (ZERO)
  - Target: First $1 (validate fulfillment), then $1k MRR
  - Measurement: Payment processor (not yet configured)

### Fulfillment (Established: 2026-02-09)

- **Order Fulfillment Time:** Not measured (no orders)
  - Target: <7 days China → EU customer
  - Measurement: Manual tracking until volume justifies automation

- **Fulfillment Success Rate:** Not measured (no orders)
  - Target: 95%+ (industry standard)
  - Measurement: Orders delivered / orders placed

### Margins (Established: 2026-02-09)

- **Gross Margin:** Not measured
  - Target: 40%+ after all costs (COGS, shipping, duties, fees)
  - Measurement: (Revenue - COGS - Shipping - Duties - Fees) / Revenue
