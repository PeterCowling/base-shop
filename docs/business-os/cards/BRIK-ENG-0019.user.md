# Reception - Stock + Cash Control Plan v2

**Source:** Migrated from `reception-stock-cash-control-plan-v2.md`


# Reception - Stock + Cash Control Plan v2

Goal: implement stock tracking, cash control, and shift reconciliation flows for the reception app, with a two-phase rollout (phase 1 = stock + static seed cash; phase 2 = full cash flow tracking).

Status: Active

Context: Current reception app handles walk-ins, discounts, and manual bookings, but does not track stock-on-hand for retail items or enforce cash control/shift reconciliation.

## Phase 1: Stock Tracking + Static Cash Seed

Minimal viable stock + cash controls, no full cash movement tracking yet.
