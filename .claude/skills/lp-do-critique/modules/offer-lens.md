# Offer Lens (Section D)

Required checks for each of the 6 lp-offer sections:

### 1. ICP Segmentation
- Demographics are falsifiable and narrow (not "25-45, all income levels")
- Psychographics tied to observable behaviors (not "likes quality")
- JTBD is specific and non-generic (not "wants to save time")
- Buying triggers include external events or internal thresholds

### 2. Pain/Promise Mapping
- Each pain row includes: pain statement, promise, quantified outcome, evidence source
- Promise claims are measurable (not "feel better" but "reduce X by Y%")
- Evidence exists and is cited (customer quotes, usage data, competitive intel)
- Pain-promise alignment is direct (promise addresses stated pain, not tangential benefit)

### 3. Offer Structure
- Core offer deliverables are enumerated with format/quantity/timeline
- Bundles differentiate clearly (not "more of everything" but distinct use cases)
- Exclusions prevent scope creep (what's explicitly NOT included)
- Guarantees are specific (refund conditions, performance thresholds, liability caps)
- Risk reversals shift buyer risk to seller (money-back, trial period, pay-on-results)

### 4. Positioning One-Pager (Geoffrey Moore template)
- "For [target customer] who [statement of need/opportunity], [product name] is a [product category] that [statement of key benefit]. Unlike [primary competitive alternative], [product name] [statement of primary differentiation]."
- Each blank filled with concrete, non-hand-wavy text
- Differentiation is defensible (not "better quality" but specific capability gap)

### 5. Pricing/Packaging Hypothesis
- Price points anchored to competitor data or willingness-to-pay research
- Justification includes cost structure, value metric, and margin requirements
- Confidence assessment includes what's known/unknown and validation plan
- Competitor comparison table exists with like-for-like feature/price mapping

### 6. Objection Map + Risk Reversal
- Each objection row includes: objection, response, proof/mechanism
- Objections cover price, trust, timing, alternatives, and implementation cost
- Responses are specific (not "we're great" but "here's how we de-risk")
- Proof is tangible (case study, money-back guarantee, free trial, social proof)

### Offer-Specific Quality Dimensions

For scoring, weight these dimensions for Offer artifacts:
- **ICP Specificity** (0.20): Demographics/psychographics narrow enough to guide channel and copy decisions
- **Positioning Distinctiveness** (0.20): Differentiation is defensible and tied to observable capability gaps
- **Pricing Justification** (0.15): Price anchored to evidence (competitor data, willingness-to-pay, cost structure)
- **Objection Completeness** (0.15): Covers top 5 objections (price, trust, timing, alternatives, implementation) with specific responses
- **Risk Reversal Strength** (0.15): Guarantee/trial/reversal mechanisms shift meaningful risk to seller
- **Evidence Quality** (0.15): Pain, promise, and positioning claims cite sources (not hypothetical)

### Munger Inversion Attacks (Offer-Specific)

Apply "Why would this offer fail?" to each section:

**ICP Inversion:**
- Is the ICP so broad that channel selection becomes impossible?
- Are psychographics so generic they could describe any customer?
- Is JTBD stated at such a high level it offers no differentiation?

**Pain/Promise Inversion:**
- Are promises unfalsifiable or untestable within a reasonable timeframe?
- Is the pain stated in the customer's language, or in consultant-speak?
- Could a competitor make the same promise with equal credibility?

**Offer Structure Inversion:**
- Are exclusions missing, inviting scope creep and margin erosion?
- Is the guarantee so weak (or absent) that it signals low confidence?
- Are risk reversals cosmetic (7-day refund) rather than substantive (pay-on-results)?

**Positioning Inversion:**
- Is the "primary competitive alternative" a strawman (outdated product, manual process) rather than the real threat?
- Is differentiation a feature list rather than a single defendable capability?
- Could this positioning apply to 3+ competitors with minor word swaps?

**Pricing Inversion:**
- Is price set by gut feel rather than anchored to willingness-to-pay or competitor data?
- Is the confidence assessment hand-wavy ("we think it's right") rather than evidence-based?
- Is the validation plan missing or non-falsifiable?

**Objection Inversion:**
- Are top objections missing (price, trust, timing, alternatives, implementation cost)?
- Are responses generic reassurances ("we're the best") rather than specific mechanisms?
- Is proof absent or weak (testimonials without metrics, vague case studies)?
