<h1>Startup Loop: What to do next for HEAD, PET, and BRIK</h1>
<h2>1) Purpose</h2>
<p>This page tells you what to do next for HEAD, PET, and BRIK — and how to do it.</p>
<h2>Today (updated 2026-02-17)</h2>
<h3>HEAD</h3>
<p><strong>Current blocker:</strong> Operational confirmations are missing — in-stock date, sellable units, pricing, compatibility, payment flow readiness, and returns SLA have not been confirmed. Measurement setup is also not yet in place.</p>
<p><strong>Do this now:</strong> Fill in the Operational Confirmations form for HEAD (all 6 fields). Then complete the Pre-website Measurement Setup checklist.</p>
<p><strong>Done when:</strong> All 6 operational fields are confirmed and timestamped. Measurement setup document is at Active status.</p>
<hr>
<h3>PET</h3>
<p><strong>Current blocker:</strong> Inventory reality is unconfirmed (units, arrival date, landed cost). No measured CPC or CVR data yet — the forecast cannot reach decision-grade without these inputs.</p>
<p><strong>Do this now:</strong> Confirm inventory units, expected arrival date, and landed cost per unit. Then run a 7-day paid acquisition test to capture the first observed CPC and CVR.</p>
<p><strong>Done when:</strong> Inventory confirmed. First measured CPC and CVR captured. Forecast upgraded to decision-grade.</p>
<hr>
<h3>BRIK</h3>
<p><strong>Current blocker:</strong> GA4 measurement signal quality is unverified. The begin_checkout and web_vitals events have not been confirmed in standard GA4 reports (non-realtime, 7-day window).</p>
<p><strong>Do this now:</strong> Open GA4 Standard Reports (NOT Realtime). Check begin_checkout for the last 7 days. Check web_vitals for the last 7 days. Document what you find.</p>
<p><strong>Done when:</strong> Non-zero signal confirmed in standard 7-day GA4 report for both begin_checkout and web_vitals. Then run the day-14 forecast recalibration.</p>
<h2>The Loop in 8 steps</h2>
<p>Every week you run the same eight steps — gather data, design your offer, forecast, prioritise, act, then review — so the business gets sharper each time round.</p>
<pre class="mermaid">flowchart LR
    N1["Setup<br/>(S0–S1)"]
    N2["Research<br/>(S2)"]
    N3["Offer Design<br/>(S2B)"]
    N4["Forecast + Channels<br/>(S3/S6B)"]
    N5["Prioritise<br/>(S4–S5)"]
    N6["Pick top actions<br/>(S5A)"]
    N7["Execute<br/>(S7–S9B)"]
    N8["Weekly review<br/>(S10)"]
    NEND["End"]

    N1 --> N2
    N2 --> N3
    N3 --> N4
    N4 --> N5
    N5 --> N6
    N6 --> N7
    N7 --> N8

    N8 -->|Continue| N2
    N8 -->|Scale| N5
    N8 -->|Kill| NEND</pre>
<p>Each week the S10 review gives you one of three verdicts: Continue (loop back to Research and sharpen your data), Scale (jump straight to Prioritise with what you already know), or Kill (end the business and move on). The loop is designed to be fast — most businesses complete the full first pass in 2–4 weeks.</p>
<h2>Readiness check</h2>
<p>Before investing time in the next stage, answer these six questions. Each one is a yes/no check. A 'No' means you have work to do first — see the action cards above.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the offer defined clearly enough to test with real customers?</li>
<li>Is measurement set up and producing real data?</li>
<li>Do we have baseline data to compare against? <em>(existing businesses only — skip if you are pre-launch)</em></li>
<li>Do we have inventory and cost inputs to build a reliable forecast?</li>
<li>Have we chosen our 2–3 launch channels and do we have a plan for each?</li>
<li>Have we selected and scored the top 2–3 things to work on next?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Business Operator Actions</h2>
<p>These are the actions owned by Pete as venture-studio operator. Each row is a concrete next step — not a platform task.</p>

<h2>Per-business action cards</h2>
<p>These cards tell you exactly what to do for each business. Each step is actionable — no code knowledge or repository access required.</p>
<h3>HEAD card</h3>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Confirm HEAD operations</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The HEAD 90-day forecast cannot become decision-grade until six operational inputs are confirmed. Without them, any planning and investment decision rests on assumptions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Confirm the in-stock date — when will the product physically be available to ship?</li>
<li>Confirm sellable units — how many units are available at launch?</li>
<li>Confirm pricing and any bundle options.</li>
<li>Provide the compatibility matrix — which devices/platforms does the product work with?</li>
<li>Confirm the payment flow is ready to accept orders.</li>
<li>Define the returns policy and SLA (how long does a return take?).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Done when:</strong> All six fields are filled in and timestamped. The Operational Confirmations form shows complete status.</p>
<hr>
<h3>PET card</h3>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Confirm PET supply and run first acquisition test</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The PET forecast is not decision-grade without real inventory data and at least one measured acquisition data point. Seed assumptions are not enough to make a confident investment decision.</p>
<ol>
<li>Confirm inventory units — how many units are on hand or on order?</li>
<li>Confirm the expected arrival date for the inventory.</li>
<li>Confirm the landed cost per unit (total cost including shipping, duties, and fees).</li>
<li>Run a small paid acquisition test for 7 days (any channel — Meta, Google, TikTok).</li>
<li>Record the observed cost per click (CPC) and conversion rate (CVR) from the test.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Done when:</strong> All inventory inputs confirmed. First measured CPC and CVR captured. Forecast document updated to decision-grade.</p>
<hr>
<h3>BRIK card</h3>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Restore GA4 measurement signal</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The weekly BRIK decision loop depends on non-zero signal from two GA4 events (begin_checkout and web_vitals) in standard 7-day reports. If these show zero, the weekly cadence cannot produce reliable data.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Google Analytics 4 → go to Standard Reports (NOT the Realtime section).</li>
<li>Navigate to Engagement → Events.</li>
<li>Set the date range to the last 7 days.</li>
<li>Check whether begin_checkout shows a non-zero count.</li>
<li>Check whether web_vitals shows a non-zero count.</li>
<li>If either is zero: open GA4 DebugView, open a live browser session on the site, and check whether the events fire during a real checkout attempt.</li>
<li>Document your findings — what you saw and whether it resolved.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Done when:</strong> Non-zero begin_checkout and web_vitals confirmed in standard 7-day GA4 report. Document saved. Then proceed to the day-14 forecast recalibration.</p>
<h2>If you have 10/30/60 minutes</h2>
<p>Already familiar with the loop? Use this guide to decide what to work on today based on the time you have.</p>
<h3>10 minutes — Check status and pick one action</h3>
<ul>
<li>Read the Today panel for the business you want to move forward.</li>
<li>Identify the single top blocker.</li>
<li>Complete one concrete step toward that blocker: fill a field in the Operational Confirmations form, run a 5-minute GA4 check, or confirm one inventory number.</li>
<li>Done: you have moved at least one blocker forward.</li>
</ul>
<h3>30 minutes — Complete a full checklist</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pick one of these and run it end-to-end:
<ul>
<li><strong>GA4 measurement verification for BRIK</strong> — open Standard Reports, check begin_checkout and web_vitals for last 7 days, run DebugView if needed, document outcome.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Confirmations for HEAD or PET</strong> — fill all 6 required fields in the form and timestamp them.</li>
<li><strong>Baseline refresh review</strong> — check whether any standing refresh prompt (market pulse, channel economics) is overdue and queue it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Done: the chosen checklist is complete and documented.</li>
</ul>
<h3>60 minutes — Produce a required artifact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pick one of these artifacts and produce it:
<ul>
<li><strong>Day-14 forecast recalibration</strong> — update the BRIK 90-day forecast using measured week-1/2 actuals to replace seed assumptions.</li>
<li><strong>Weekly K/P/C/S decision</strong> — run the weekly Keep/Pivot/Scale/Kill review for HEAD, PET, or BRIK and produce the decision document.</li>
<li><strong>Complete action card</strong> — pick one business, work through all steps in its action card, and mark it done.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Done: the artifact exists and is dated today.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Critical Rule:</strong> BRIK does not proceed past S2/S6 while the S2A historical baseline is missing or draft.</p>
<p><strong>Data Flow:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>S2A baseline → consumed by S2 (market sizing validation), S3 (forecast anchoring), S6 (traffic patterns), S10 (growth measurement)</li>
<li>When S2A is blocked due to missing data, workflow hands user the S2A data-request prompt and pauses until data pack is supplied</li>
<li>S10 weekly decisions compare measured actuals vs baseline to calculate growth rate and trigger recalibration when guardrails break</li>

<h2>Deep Research Gate (S2 + S6) [Engineering Reference]</h2>
<h3>9.1 Mandatory hand-off rule</h3>
<p>When either S2 (market intelligence) or S6 (site-upgrade brief) is in a seed/draft state, the workflow must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop progression for that business at the affected stage.</li>
<li>Hand the user a ready-to-run Deep Research prompt file (not a template with placeholders).</li>
<li>Require Deep Research completion and persistence before continuing downstream stages.</li>
</ol>
<p>Seed/draft trigger conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>latest.user.md</code> is <code>Missing</code>, or</li>
<li><code>latest.user.md</code> points to a source doc with <code>Status: Draft</code>, or</li>
<li>source doc is stale (<code>Last-reviewed</code> older than 30 days), or</li>
<li>major outcome/ICP/channel/product change occurred.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional existing-business trigger:</p>
<ul>
<li>For <code>website-live</code> businesses, if S2A historical baseline is missing, <code>Draft</code>, or <code>Blocked</code>, S2/S6 must remain blocked.</li>
<li>If S2A result is <code>Blocked</code> due to missing data, hand the user an S2A data-request prompt immediately and pause until data is supplied.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pre-website measurement trigger:</p>
<ul>
<li>For <code>pre-website</code> businesses, S2 onward should be treated as <code>warning</code> quality unless S1B measurement bootstrap output exists and its verification checklist has passed.</li>
<li>If S1B output is missing, hand the user the S1B measurement-bootstrap prompt immediately and pause paid-traffic launch planning until completed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.2 Required operator hand-off message</h3>
<pre><code class="language-text">Deep Research completion is required for {{BIZ}} at stage {{S2|S6}}.

Use this ready-to-run prompt file:
{{PROMPT_FILE_PATH}}

Run Deep Research, then save/replace target output:
{{TARGET_OUTPUT_PATH}}

After saving:
1) Ensure output doc is decision-grade and set Status: Active.
2) Update latest pointer (`latest.user.md`) with source path.
3) Render HTML companion:
   pnpm docs:render-user-html -- {{TARGET_OUTPUT_PATH}}
</code></pre>
<h3>9.3 Current required hand-offs (now)</h3>

<h2>Operator Interface [Engineering Reference]</h2>
<p>Startup Loop needs a single operator interaction pattern so users do not guess the next step.
Canonical chat wrapper skill: <code>.claude/skills/startup-loop/SKILL.md</code>.</p>
<h3>13.1 Command-style interaction contract</h3>
<p>Use this command pattern in agent chat:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>/startup-loop start --business &#x3C;BIZ> --mode &#x3C;dry|live> --launch-surface &#x3C;pre-website|website-live></code></li>
<li><code>/startup-loop status --business &#x3C;BIZ></code></li>
<li><code>/startup-loop submit --business &#x3C;BIZ> --stage &#x3C;S#> --artifact &#x3C;path></code></li>
<li><code>/startup-loop advance --business &#x3C;BIZ></code></li>

<h3>13.3 Advance rule</h3>
<p>A stage is considered complete only when both are true:</p>
<ol>
<li>Required artifact is written and valid.</li>
<li>Required Business OS sync actions are confirmed complete.</li>
</ol>
<p>If either is missing, the run stays <code>blocked</code> at current stage.</p>
<p><strong>Brand gates enforced on advance (see <code>.claude/skills/startup-loop/SKILL.md</code> for full gate definitions):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GATE-BD-01</strong> (Hard): S1 advance blocked until <code>brand-dossier.user.md</code> exists at Draft minimum in strategy index.</li>
<li><strong>GATE-BD-03</strong> (Hard): S2B completion blocked until <code>messaging-hierarchy.user.md</code> exists at Draft minimum in strategy index.</li>
<li><strong>GATE-BD-08</strong> (Soft — warning only): S10 emits a staleness warning if brand-dossier <code>Last-reviewed</code> > 90 days.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Business OS Sync Contract (No Loop-to-BOS Drift) [Engineering Reference]</h2>
<p>Startup Loop artifacts and Business OS state must move together.</p>
<h3>14.1 Write-path rule</h3>
<p>For cards, ideas, and stage docs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canonical write path is Business OS UI/API (<code>/api/agent/*</code>) to D1.</li>
<li>Do not treat markdown mirror under <code>docs/business-os/cards/</code> and <code>docs/business-os/ideas/</code> as editable source-of-truth.</li>
