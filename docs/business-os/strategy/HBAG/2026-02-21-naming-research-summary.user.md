# HBAG Naming Research Summary + Preferred Approach (Round 2)

**Scope:** Brand naming for a premium artisan, Italian-origin accessory brand. Initial hero product: Birkin-style mini "micro-bag" used as bag charm + AirPods Pro holder, plus Amalfi destination variant. Hard constraints include bilingual IT/EN pronounceability, no luxury-house adjacency, and .com availability at standard registration price as a non-negotiable gate.

---

## 1. What the Research Established

### A. Domain ownability is now the controlling constraint

Learning from Round 1: even strong aesthetic candidates fail if the .com is in use, parked, or aftermarket-priced.

**Operational implication:** naming must be run as a domain-first funnel, not a "creative shortlist → check later" process.

**Method basis:** ICANN has formally transitioned gTLD registration data access from WHOIS to RDAP, reinforcing RDAP as the modern baseline for registration lookups; Verisign provides RDAP access for registered .com domains.

### B. Category momentum supports "personalisation" and "playful elevation"

Bag charms are a clear, durable fashion behaviour signal (personalisation / "Birkin-ification") with strong social media and runway reinforcement. Vogue explicitly frames bag charms as a major TikTok product trend; Vogue Italy describes charms as a personalisation tactic for "telling your story"; Etsy publishes trend reports grounded in Etsy search data (useful as marketplace-demand signals).

**Net takeaway:** the name does not have to explain the product (the behaviour already exists); it has to feel ownable, premium, and story-capable.

### C. Competitive naming landscape: what's crowded vs open

**Crowded patterns**

- "French house mimicry" (Maison/Atelier/House-of formats): Maison de Sabré openly uses a prestige-house register.
- Eponymous designer-name register (hard to emulate credibly without a real designer persona).
- Place + gem/colour combos (recognisable but often generic/occupied).

**What's working in-market**

- House-coded craft minimalism: Polène explicitly positions as a "French House" with craftsmanship-forward language.
- Personalisation framing: Anya Hindmarch uses direct language ("Make your bag your own… playful note"), i.e., identity expression over function.
- Sophisticated craft accessories brand language: Cala Jade positions around "sophisticated, handcrafted leather bags and accessories."

**Open territory (highest headroom under current constraints):**

- Short coined words with Italian-friendly phonetics, built domain-first.
- Craft/metier metaphors (only when softened/humanised; avoid technical dryness).
- Place-rooted quality cues (light/air/stone/cove) without literal place-name trapping.

## 2. Preferred Naming Approach (Forced Choice)

**Recommendation: a coined, Italian-phonetic masterbrand (single token, 5–8 letters), run domain-first.**

**Why this wins under current constraints:**

| Factor | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| Ownability | Coined tokens are the most realistic path to a clean .com — Round 1 attrition makes this decisive |
| Bilingual performance | Italian phonotactics (open vowels, simple syllables) are pronounceable in English when awkward clusters are avoided |
| Expansion headroom | A non-descriptive masterbrand extends naturally into SLGs, pouches, seasonal drops |
| Avoids luxury-house adjacency | Steer feel to artisan + place-rooted without using protected luxury vocabulary or house-like naming forms |

---

## 3. Practical Naming System Rules

For coherent brand architecture once a name is chosen:

- **Masterbrand:** coined, Italian-friendly, warm, human. Not "maison/atelier", not descriptive.
- **Product naming:** functional-but-elevated line names that can scale (e.g., "Charm Clip", "Case", "Mini Pouch") under the masterbrand; keep the masterbrand free of function.
- **Story hook:** each coined name needs a 10-second boutique story (place-quality, craft sensibility, or emotion), even if the word is invented.

## 4. Risk Controls (Domain + Trademark) Built Into the Pipeline

| Gate | Type | Rule |
|------|------|------|
| Domain | **Hard** | .com available at standard registration price — only names passing this survive |
| Trademark pre-screen | Soft (not legal clearance) | Use TMview/EUIPO to flag obvious conflicts across Nice Classes 18/14/25; definitive clearance requires counsel |
| Cross-language screen | Soft | Fast checks for unintended meanings in IT/FR/ES/DE |

## 6. Next Step

Run `candidate-names-prompt-r2.md` in a deep research tool (OpenAI Deep Research or equivalent).

The prompt instructs the tool to generate a pipeline of ~50 coined candidates, apply the .com hard-blocker gate at time of check (RDAP/registrar, dated), and return only a shortlist of 5–8 names with confirmed .com availability, TM pre-screen, and cross-language risk flags.
