# PRODUCTS-02 — Competitor Product Scan

## 1. Adjacent SKU Landscape

This section maps the competitive product landscape around Caryina's two launch functions (H1 bag charm, H2 AirPods holder) by examining what buyers actually encounter when browsing comparable terms on Etsy and adjacent DTC channels. Organized by product type, not by brand.

### 1A. Bag Charm SKUs (H1 adjacents)

#### Budget tier (<$30) — the noise floor

Etsy's "Mini Bag Charms" browse page shows 5,000+ items. The dominant price cues for handbag-shaped mini accessories skew low: a representative listing is explicitly a "mini purse bag charm … faux leather … tiny purse airpod case", priced around $11 (sale). This demonstrates that the "tiny handbag" silhouette is already legible to Etsy shoppers as a low-cost novelty category, and some competitor listings explicitly tie the silhouette to the AirPods use-case at budget price points.

| Competitor | Product | Price | Materials | Attachment | Scale Signal |
|-----------|---------|-------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Generic Etsy sellers (multiple) | Mini purse bag charm / faux leather tiny purse | ~$11 (sale) | Faux leather | Keyring / clip | 5,000+ items in category |
| Generic novelty charms | Resin / acrylic mini bag shapes | $5–$15 | Resin, acrylic, fabric | Lobster clasp | High volume, low differentiation |

**Risk to Caryina:** Misclassification. If listing photos don't immediately separate the product from this tier, Etsy's algorithm and buyer perception will anchor H1 against $11 novelties, not $95 Coach charms. Additionally, Etsy's broad market pages blend physical products with digital patterns and templates (often €1–€6) — the "Exclude digital items" filter exists for "Mini Bag Charms," meaning buyers can be exposed to ultra-low digital products that compress perceived value.

#### Mid-market tier ($50–$80) — craft-premium Etsy sellers

| Competitor | Product | Price | Materials | Differentiator | Scale Signal |
|-----------|---------|-------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| SexylittleVintage | Multi-charm keychain with "luxury bag" framing | $69–$79 | Mixed; vachetta language | "Vintage designer" curation; one-of-a-kind | ~3.7k reviews, ~14k sales |
| YLSecretHeart | Leather flower charm / "Kelly Bag Charms" | ~$76–$77 | Handmade leather | Floral artisan aesthetic; gifting language | ~655 reviews, ~2.3k sales |
| TyransLeatherShop | Leather orchid bag charms | $72–$89 | Leather | "Wearable art"; customisation options | ~33 reviews, Star Seller |
| Sticky Zoo (DTC) | Stacked object charms (animal themes) | €61–€76+ | Mixed | Limited drops; "stackable" collecting mechanic | Claims 10,630+ reviews, IG ~230k |

**Caryina's position vs this tier:** Price overlap at €89 — but Caryina's structured silhouette (turn-lock clasp, side gussets, facade applique) is architecturally distinct from floral/beaded/stacked charm formats. The differentiation is "miniature handbag" vs "decorative object on a clip." Photography must make this distinction instant.

#### Premium tier ($90–$150) — artisan and fashion-brand anchors

| Competitor | Product | Price | Materials | Differentiator | Scale Signal |
|-----------|---------|-------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| SPECSET | Freshwater pearl bag charm chain | ~$104 | Pearls, metal chain | Bag jewellery; luxury chain decoration | ~839 reviews, Star Seller, "Low in stock" |
| String Ting (DTC) | Beaded "Bag Tings" | £65–£250 | Beads, mixed media | Hand-strung in London; lifetime re-string guarantee | Claims 55,000+ orders |
| Coach | Cassette Bag Charm, Cherry Heritage Leather Bag Charm | €95 | Leather | Accessible premium brand recognition | Brand-scale distribution |

**Caryina's position vs this tier:** €89 deliberately undercuts Coach at €95 — the most recognisable accessible-premium anchor. SPECSET and String Ting prove Etsy/DTC buyers will pay $100+ for charm objects, but these are jewellery/bead formats, not structured leather micro-bags. Caryina occupies a genuine white space: handbag-shaped + artisan-tier price.

#### Luxury tier (€290+) — aspiration anchors

| Brand | Product | Price | Materials | Relevance |
|-------|---------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Fendi | Nano Baguette Charm (snap hook, holds headphones/keys/lipstick) | €670–€1,900 | Nappa leather / embellished satin | **Closest architectural analogue** — nano-bag as attachable charm with functional capacity |
| Fendi | Charm and strap accessories (category) | €290–€980 | Various | Validates "micro bag as charm" category at luxury |
| Dior | "Key Rings and Bag Charms" category | €300–€800+ | Various; seasonal | Positions charms as "precious fetishes"; seasonal refresh model |
| Coach (upper range) | Premium bag charms | Up to €225 | Leather | Upper bound of accessible premium |

**Caryina's position vs luxury:** The Fendi Nano Baguette Charm is the most important reference — it explicitly functions as an attachable micro-bag with stated capacity for "headphones, keys, or lipstick," which is exactly Caryina's H1/H2 architecture. Caryina at €89/€119 is positioned as an accessible alternative to a €670+ Fendi, with the same conceptual logic (miniature bag as charm) but artisan rather than maison pricing.

### 1B. AirPods Holder SKUs (H2 adjacents)

#### Budget-to-mid tier (<$50) — the commodity field

An Etsy browse page scoped to "Leather Airpod Case Keychain" shows 888+ items, with many visible price points clustering below ~$40. A concrete example: an "Italian leather keychain" AirPods case priced at €25.62+, with model-specific pricing such as €28.40 for AirPods Pro variants; the listing emphasises "keychain" attachment and personalisation as standard expectations. The broader "Airpods Case" market page shows 5,000+ items.

| Competitor | Product | Price | Materials | Attachment | Fit Claims |
|-----------|---------|-------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Generic Etsy (hundreds) | Leather AirPods case with keychain | €25–$40 | Leather / PU | Keyring, carabiner | Model-specific (Pro, Pro 2, AirPods 4) |
| NitmoiStudio | Italian leather AirPods Pro 3 case, brass clip | $55+ | Full-grain Italian leather | Solid brass clip | AirPods Pro 3 explicit |

**Risk to Caryina:** Commodity expectation. Etsy buyers browsing "AirPods case" are conditioned to model-specific fit + keychain attachment + personalisation at $25–$55. H2 at €119 must be categorised as "bag jewellery that holds AirPods" — not as an expensive version of a $30 case.

#### Premium tier ($60–$100) — craft leather cases

| Competitor | Product | Price | Materials | Differentiator | Scale Signal |
|-----------|---------|-------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| TRIMleather | Leather AirPods case, honey brown | $69.90 | Full-grain Italian cowhide | "Sturdy brass clasp"; 14-year Etsy presence | ~2.5k reviews, ~14.5k sales |
| PEGAI | Python leather AirPods case | $99 | Full-grain hides (python texture) | Suede lining, magnetic closure, "giftable luxury" | ~18.7k reviews, ~107k sales, Star Seller |
| MAISON de SABRÉ (DTC) | Full-leather AirPods case + charm ecosystem | AUD $75 (often discounted) | Full-grain leather | Monogram; "world's most luxurious AirPods Case" | 845 reviews on product page |

**Caryina's position vs this tier:** PEGAI at $99 is the most dangerous direct competitor — massive social proof and polished gift framing. But PEGAI ships US-only, reducing EU competitive pressure. TRIMleather is functional-minimalist, not fashion-first — Caryina's "bag accessory" frame is a differentiated position. The critical gap: none of these competitors use a structured handbag silhouette for the AirPods case. That architectural difference is Caryina's wedge.

#### Luxury-tech tier ($1,000+) — aspiration anchors

| Brand | Product | Price | Materials | Relevance |
|-------|---------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Hermès | AirPods Pro case, Swift calfskin with carabiner hook | $1,125–$1,625 | Swift calfskin | Proves premium buyer exists for fashion-object AirPods carry |
| Hermès | Other tech accessories | $500+ | Various | Brand halo validates "tech accessory as fashion object" |

**Caryina's position vs luxury-tech:** €119 becomes legible as an "accessible luxury" bid only if the product presentation makes shoppers categorise it as bag jewellery / crafted object, not "an AirPods case." The "mini bag that holds headphones" framing is explicitly used by Fendi (Nano Baguette Charm), which strengthens the conceptual validity — but means the product must look like it belongs in that category (structure, closure, hardware, finish).

## 2. Pricing Benchmarks — Consolidated Price Ladder

| Tier | Price Band | Representative SKUs | What Buyers Expect |
|------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Novelty** | $5–$15 | Faux leather mini purse charms; resin shapes; digital patterns | Impulse buy; no quality expectation; disposable |
| **Budget craft** | $15–$40 | Leather AirPods cases with keychain; simple leather charms | Model-specific fit; personalisation; fast shipping |
| **Mid-market artisan** | $50–$80 | SexylittleVintage ($69–$79); YLSecretHeart (~$77); TRIMleather ($70); NitmoiStudio ($55+) | Handmade feel; "real leather" claims; gifting-ready; Etsy reviews as trust signal |
| **Premium artisan** | $80–$120 | SPECSET (~$104); TyransLeatherShop (~$89); PEGAI ($99); **Caryina H1 (€89) / H2 (€119)** | Visible craft quality; origin story; hardware detail; editorial photography; gift packaging |
| **Accessible luxury brand** | €95–€225 | Coach bag charms (€95–€225) | Brand recognition; retail distribution; brand packaging |
| **Luxury brand** | €290–€1,900 | Fendi Nano Baguette Charm (€670–€1,900); Dior charms (€300+); Hermès AirPods case ($1,125–$1,625) | Maison provenance; exotic materials; collectibility; secondary market value |

**Caryina launch prices in context:**
- **H1 at €89** sits at the top of "premium artisan" and just below the Coach anchor (€95). This is the "obvious yes" zone identified in the intake packet — below €100, perceived as considered but not extravagant.
- **H2 at €119** sits above the premium artisan ceiling and below accessible luxury brands. It requires the "bag jewellery that holds AirPods" frame to justify the premium over PEGAI ($99) and TRIMleather ($70).

## 4. Competitive Differentiation Notes

### Where Caryina wins on product

1. **Architectural uniqueness.** No competitor on Etsy sells a structured micro-handbag-silhouette charm at the €80–€120 price point. The closest analogue is Fendi's Nano Baguette Charm at €670+. This is the core product differentiation.

2. **Cross-function versatility.** The same body serves as both charm (H1) and tech holder (H2), giving Caryina a product story that no single competitor replicates — "a bag for your bag" that also "holds your AirPods."

3. **Hardware detail as premium signal.** Turn-lock clasp, keeper bars, and strap closure read as "bag hardware" — not "charm hardware." This is a direct sensory differentiator against clip-and-ring competitors.

4. **Facade applique as brand signature.** The three-arched-window motif is a recognisable design element that no competitor has. If executed consistently, it becomes a visual brand mark across the product line.

5. **EU-based shipping.** PEGAI (the strongest Etsy H2 competitor at $99) is US-only. Italy-based fulfilment gives Caryina a structural EU shipping advantage.

### Where Caryina is vulnerable on product

1. **Zero social proof.** Every mid-market and premium Etsy competitor has hundreds to thousands of reviews. Caryina launches with zero. The first 10–20 reviews are existentially important.

2. **Material ambiguity.** Competitors explicitly claim "full-grain Italian leather," "Italian cowhide," "Swift calfskin." Caryina's material substrate is unknown — "leather-look" is not a premium claim. If the material is PU or bonded leather, the premium pricing story weakens significantly.

3. **Attachment hardware gap.** No clip/carabiner/keyring is visible in product photography. Competitors universally show and describe attachment hardware. This is a P0 blocker for H1 listing.

4. **AirPods fit proof.** Commodity competitors specify exact model fit with internal photos. Caryina has confirmed fit (TASK-03) but has no published evidence. AirPods case dimensions (Pro 2: 45.2 × 60.6 × 21.7 mm; AirPods 4: 46.2 × 50.1 × 21.2 mm) must be mapped to interior cavity shots.

5. **Price justification burden.** At €119, H2 is 70% more expensive than TRIMleather ($70) and 20% more than PEGAI ($99). The "bag jewellery" frame must be instantly legible or the listing gets compared to commodity cases.

### Competitor weaknesses Caryina can exploit

| Competitor | Weakness | Caryina's Counter |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| SPECSET | Pearl charm "very delicate" — broke on first attachment (buyer review) | Emphasise hardware durability; show stress-test or daily-use context |
| SexylittleVintage | Reseller identity (vintage bags primary, charms secondary) | "Pure artisan accessory brand" — single-product-world credibility |
| TRIMleather | Functional minimalism; no fashion-first photography | Editorial lifestyle photography; structured silhouette reads "fashion object" |
| PEGAI | US-only shipping; can't serve EU market | Italy-based fulfilment; EU VAT-compliant |
| Sticky Zoo | Trustpilot complaints (shipping, returns, service) | Over-communicate dispatch/arrival; proactive shipping updates; Etsy's built-in trust framework |
| Generic novelty tier | Faux leather; no hardware; disposable | Materials, hardware, and construction visible in listing photos |

## 5. Etsy Fee Impact on Competitive Pricing

For an Italy-based Etsy shop, the core variable fee stack is:
- Transaction fee: 6.5%
- Payment processing (Italy bank): 4% + €0.30
- Regulatory operating fee (Italy): 0.32%
- **Base total: ~10.82% + €0.30 per order**
- With Offsite Ads (shops <$10K trailing): +15%, pushing total to ~mid-20% range

**Net revenue per SKU (base Etsy band, no Offsite Ads):**

| SKU | List Price | Etsy Base Fees (~11%) | Fixed | Net to Seller | Target COGS (~€35) | Gross Margin |
|-----|-----------|----------------------|-------|--------------|--------------------|-----------:|
| H1 | €89 | ~€9.63 | €0.30 | ~€79.07 | €35 | ~€44.07 (49.5%) |
| H2 | €119 | ~€12.87 | €0.30 | ~€105.83 | €35 | ~€70.83 (59.5%) |

**With Offsite Ads attributed (+15%):**

| SKU | List Price | Total Etsy Take (~26%) | Net to Seller | Target COGS | Gross Margin |
|-----|-----------|----------------------|--------------|------------|------------:|
| H1 | €89 | ~€23.14 | ~€65.56 | €35 | ~€30.56 (34.3%) |
| H2 | €119 | ~€30.94 | ~€87.76 | €35 | ~€52.76 (44.3%) |

**Competitive implication:** H1 at €89 with Offsite Ads dips to ~34% gross margin — close to the minimum 35% contribution margin target in the outcome contract. H2 at €119 has comfortable margin even with ads. This reinforces that H2 may be the more sustainable SKU long-term, and H1 pricing has almost no room for discounting or promotional offers.

## 6. Key Takeaways for Listing Strategy

1. **Prevent misclassification.** Listings must stop buyers categorising H1 as a $11 novelty charm or H2 as a $30 AirPods case. Hero images need: structured silhouette on a recognisable handbag strap (H1), or the micro-bag standing alone as an object then shown holding AirPods (H2).

2. **Lead with architecture, not materials.** Until material substrate is confirmed, the strongest differentiator is the structured handbag form factor — turn-lock, gussets, facade. No Etsy competitor at any price has this.

3. **Compatibility as conversion driver for H2.** "Fits AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4" should be treated as a primary conversion driver, not a footnote — Etsy buyers scan for model coverage first and aesthetics second.

4. **Apple trademark discipline.** Apple's published guidance emphasises using trademarks appropriately without implying endorsement. Use numeric model naming ("AirPods Pro 2") per Apple's editorial guidance; do not use Apple logos or "Made for" marks without licence.

5. **Etsy transparency advantage.** Etsy requires accurate representation of how items are made and prohibits reselling mass-produced goods as handmade. Caryina's "designed in Italy, original design with disclosed production partner" narrative aligns directly with platform rules and counters buyer trust anxiety about resellers.

6. **First reviews are existential.** Against competitors with hundreds to thousands of reviews, Caryina's zero-review state is the single biggest conversion barrier. Early orders should be optimised for review generation (follow-up messaging, packaging inserts where Etsy-compliant).

## 7. Refresh Cadence

This document refreshes when:
- New competitors emerge in the €60–€150 Etsy bag charm / AirPods case space
- Caryina launches and real listing performance data becomes available
- Pricing changes (own or competitor) shift the competitive landscape
- Post-launch: monthly, incorporating conversion rate vs competitor benchmarks
