    {
      "q": "What happens if my ferry cancels and I have a prepaid ticket?",
      "a": "Most operators offer refunds or rebooking for weather cancellations. Check the operator's cancellation policy when you book, and keep your ticket or confirmation email. If ferries cancel, switch to the bus — it runs all year and isn't affected by sea conditions."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is the ferry good for young children or elderly passengers?",
      "a": "Yes, but think about mobility and comfort: boarding means stepping onto a boat (sometimes with a small ramp), and the sea can be choppy. Life jackets are available. If mobility is a concern or weather looks uncertain, the bus may be a better choice."

    {
      "q": "Can I take a stroller or wheelchair on the ferry?",
      "a": "Most ferries can fit strollers and wheelchairs, but space is limited and boarding help may be minimal. Contact the operator ahead to confirm access and ask for help. The bus may be easier for some travelers."

    {
      "q": "How early should I arrive at the pier?",
      "a": "Arrive at least 20–30 minutes before departure in low season, and 30–45 minutes in high season (July–August). This gives you time to find the right booth, swap vouchers if needed, and queue without stress."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do ferries run in winter?",
      "a": "Ferry service is very limited or stops completely from November through March. Always check operator websites before planning winter trips. The bus is your best option in winter months."
