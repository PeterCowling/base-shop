## Readiness check

Before investing time in the next stage, answer these six questions. Each one is a yes/no check. A 'No' means you have work to do first — see the action cards above.

1. Is the offer defined clearly enough to test with real customers?
2. Is measurement set up and producing real data?
3. Do we have baseline data to compare against? *(existing businesses only — skip if you are pre-launch)*
4. Do we have inventory and cost inputs to build a reliable forecast?
5. Have we chosen our 2–3 launch channels and do we have a plan for each?
6. Have we selected and scored the top 2–3 things to work on next?
