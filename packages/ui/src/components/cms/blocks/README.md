# CMS Blocks

Reusable content blocks for the page builder. Each block accepts optional
`width`, `height`, `margin` and `padding` props so editors can control layout
per instance. Components can snap to fill their parent when resized near the
container edge. Hold `Shift` while resizing to force a block to fill 100% of
the available width or height, or use the "100%" quick actions in the editor.
