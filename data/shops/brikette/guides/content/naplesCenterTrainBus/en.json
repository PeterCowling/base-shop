Total cost is around €7.20 (train €4.60 + bus €2.60) compared to €100+ for a private transfer or €10-15 for the direct Curreri bus from Naples Airport.\n\nThe Circumvesuviana train departs from Napoli Garibaldi station (beneath the main Napoli Centrale terminal) every 30 minutes during peak hours. From Sorrento, SITA buses to Positano run approximately every 40-60 minutes in summer (April-October) and every 60-90 minutes in winter (November-March).\n\nAlways check current schedules at sitasudtrasporti.it as services change seasonally. Allow 3-3.5 hours total including connection time in Sorrento.\n\nThis route does not cover travel from Naples Airport — see our %LINK:naplesAirportBus|Naples Airport bus guide% for that journey.",

      "body": "The Circumvesuviana is a regional train network separate from Italy's national rail system (Trenitalia). If you arrive at Napoli Centrale (the main station), head downstairs following signs for 'Circumvesuviana' or 'Garibaldi Metro'.\n\nThe Circumvesuviana platforms are on the lower level, accessed via escalators or stairs near the main entrance. Ticket windows and self-service machines are at platform level — buy your ticket to Sorrento before boarding (€4.60 one-way in 2026).\n\nTickets can be purchased with cash or card from the ticket office or yellow automatic machines. Validate your ticket in the small green or yellow machines on the platform before boarding.\n\nTrains to Sorrento depart every 30 minutes during peak hours (7am-9am, 5pm-8pm) and every 60 minutes during off-peak times. Check departure boards for 'Sorrento via Pompei' — your train will stop at Pompei Scavi-Villa dei Misteri if you want to visit the ruins.\n\nJourney time is 70 minutes. Trains can be crowded, especially in summer and on weekends. There's limited luggage space, so board early if you have large bags. Seats are first-come, first-served, and you may need to stand during busy periods.",

      "body": "When you arrive at Sorrento Circumvesuviana station, exit through the main doors and turn left. The SITA bus stop is about 50 meters away at the bottom of a short staircase.\n\nBefore heading to the bus stop, you must buy your ticket — SITA buses do not sell tickets on board. Look for any nearby bar, tabacchi (tobacco shop), or newsstand displaying the SITA logo.\n\nThe ticket office is often at Bar Circolo or Bar Fauno, both within 100 meters of the station exit. Ask for 'un biglietto per Positano' (a ticket to Positano). Cost is €2.60 in 2026.\n\nYou can also use the EAV Campania app to buy digital tickets, but service can be unreliable. From our experience, the physical ticket is more dependable.\n\nOnce you have your ticket, head to the SITA bus stop (look for the blue and white SITA sign). Buses to Positano are marked 'Amalfi via Positano' or simply 'Amalfi'.\n\nBuses depart approximately every 40-60 minutes in high season (April-October) and every 60-90 minutes in low season (November-March). Peak summer services (July-August) may run every 30 minutes.\n\nThe journey to Positano takes 45-50 minutes. We recommend sitting on the right side of the bus for stunning coastal views. The road is narrow and winding — this is one of the world's most scenic bus routes.\n\nFor more detail on reading the schedule and choosing your stop, see %LINK:chiesaNuovaDepartures|our Chiesa Nuova departures guide%.",

Here's how to read them from our hostel's experience helping guests:\n\n(1) Find the column labeled 'Sorrento' at the top — this is your departure point.\n\n(2) Scan down to find 'Positano (Chiesa Nuova)' or just 'Positano' in the left column.\n\n(3) The times listed are when the bus reaches Positano, not when it departs Sorrento. Subtract 45-50 minutes to estimate departure from Sorrento.\n\n(4) Services marked 'Festivi' run on Sundays and holidays only. Services marked 'Feriali' run Monday-Saturday.\n\n(5) Some buses skip certain stops — if you see a dash instead of a time, that bus doesn't stop there.\n\nAlways check for the latest timetable at sitasudtrasporti.it or ask at the ticket office. Download a photo of the current schedule on your phone before traveling in case internet access is limited on the coast."

Tell the driver 'Chiesa Nuova, per favore' when you board so they know where you're getting off.\n\nPress the stop button when you see the Bar Internazionale on your right.

On the bus, there's a small luggage area at the back, but it fills quickly. Large suitcases may need to be placed in the aisle during busy periods.\n\nKeep valuables with you — petty theft can occur on crowded trains, particularly during peak tourist season. The Circumvesuviana has basic facilities (no toilets, no air conditioning on older trains). Bring water, especially in summer.\n\nThe SITA bus has no toilet either, so use facilities at Sorrento station before boarding.

      "body": "The Circumvesuviana is a commuter train, not a tourist service. Expect basic conditions: hard plastic seats, no air conditioning on older trains, and crowded carriages during rush hour (7-9am, 5-8pm).\n\nIn summer, the train can be very hot. Bring water and dress in layers. The train windows open, providing some ventilation, but carriages can still be uncomfortable in peak heat. Many locals stand near the doors for better airflow.\n\nThe SITA bus journey is spectacular but nerve-wracking if you're not used to narrow coastal roads. Drivers are experienced and make this journey multiple times daily, but the road has tight bends and steep drops with minimal barriers. Sit on the right side for the best views of the coastline (and less exposure to the cliff edge if heights make you nervous).\n\nBoth services run year-round, but winter schedules (November-March) are significantly reduced. Summer schedules (April-October) are frequent and reliable, though buses can fill up by mid-morning in peak season (July-August). If traveling in peak summer, aim for morning departures to avoid standing room only.\n\nFrom the hostel, we've noticed that most guests find the journey straightforward once they understand the steps. The main confusion is usually buying the bus ticket at Sorrento — just remember you can't buy on board.",
