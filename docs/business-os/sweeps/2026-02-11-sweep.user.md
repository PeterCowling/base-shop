## 1. Executive Summary

Dry-run sweep completed with full coverage across all 8 businesses (up from 4 in the prior sweep). The dominant cross-business constraint remains **measurement blindness** — no business has production-grade analytics instrumentation, and the 5 startup businesses (XA, HEAD, PET, HBAG, plus PIPE) lack even basic outcome contracts. Under `improve-data` stance, all promoted ideas target the Measure MACRO category.

**Top 3 actions (Musk-ordered — question/delete/simplify first):**
1. **PIPE: Product selection scorecard + competitive landscape** (P1) — Stop building catalog infrastructure; validate what to sell first.
2. **XA: Define outcome contract** (P2) — Stop unfocused exploration; name one metric, one target, one deadline.
3. **BOS: Register missing businesses in Agent API** (P2) — Fix the data gap that makes sweeps incomplete.

**Critical finding:** 5 of 8 businesses (PIPE, XA, HEAD, PET, HBAG) are not registered in the Agent API `businesses` endpoint. The API returns only PLAT, BRIK, BOS. All 5 have filesystem plans and maturity model positions. This is an operational data gap that degrades sweep quality.

**Prior sweep reaffirmations:** All 4 promoted ideas from the 2026-02-10 sweep remain valid (BRIK Measurement Baseline Sprint, PIPE Fulfillment Signal Loop, PLAT Build Reliability Baseline, BOS Cabinet Outcome Scoreboard). Both held DGPs also remain valid (PIPE demand validation, BRIK guide measurement taxonomy).

## 2. Businesses Analyzed

| Business | Type | Level | Constraint | MACRO | Confidence |
|----------|------|-------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| BRIK | Revenue | L2→L3 | Zero analytics (GA not configured) | Measure | 90 |
| PIPE | Revenue | L1 | Zero revenue, no fulfilled orders | Measure | 95 |
| XA | Revenue | Pre-L1 | No outcome contract, no baseline metrics | Measure | 90 |
| HEAD | Revenue | Pre-L1 | No offer defined, no demand signals | Measure | 85 |
| PET | Revenue | Pre-L1 | No category bet, no margin proxy | Measure | 85 |
| HBAG | Revenue | Pre-L1 | Newly separated from XA, no standalone metrics | Measure | 80 |
| PLAT | Enabler | L3+ infra | Build/test reliability unmeasured | Operate | 75 |
| BOS | Enabler | Coordination | Cabinet sweep ROI unmeasured | Operate | 70 |

## 3. Who Said What (F1)

|------|----------|-----------|------|------|---------|
| Product Selection + Competitive Landscape | PIPE | lafley+finder | marketing+sourcing | presentable | Promote (P1) |
| XA Outcome Contract | XA | musk | feasibility | presentable | Promote (P2) |
| Register Missing Businesses in API | cross-cutting | code-review | code-review | presentable | Promote (P2) |
| HEAD Outcome Contract | HEAD | musk | feasibility | presentable | Promote (P3) |
| PET Category Lock + Margin Baseline | PET | musk | feasibility | presentable | Promote (P3) |

## 4. Reaffirmations/Addenda

| Prior Idea | Business | Prior Sweep | Status | Addenda This Sweep |
|-----------|----------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Measurement Baseline Sprint (GA + GSC) | BRIK | 2026-02-10 | Promoted | bezos: add customer-journey input metrics; hopkins: add per-guide content tracking; lafley: add FMOT/SMOT instrumentation; chambers: add booking channel attribution |
| Fulfillment Signal Loop | PIPE | 2026-02-10 | Promoted | musk: reaffirmed — configuration before infrastructure; mover: add landed-cost reality check |
| Demand Validation before Catalog Expansion | PIPE | 2026-02-10 | Held (DGP) | bezos: add customer persona definition; chambers: add marketplace channel selection |
| Build Reliability Baseline | PLAT | 2026-02-10 | Promoted | No new addenda |
| Cabinet Outcome Scoreboard | BOS | 2026-02-10 | Promoted | No new addenda |

## 5. Generation Phase

**Sub-experts run:** musk, bezos, hopkins (marketing), ogilvy (marketing), reeves (marketing), lafley (marketing), patterson (sales), benioff (sales), chambers (sales), finder (sourcing), bridge (sourcing), mover (sourcing). For BRIK: additional brikette lens experts (crawford, nakajima, starck, deming, kroc, gawande, schulze, meyer, degroff, schrager, jones, generator, hopkins/ogilvy/sutherland brikette variants).

**Divergence pass:** 11 raw candidates across 8 businesses (max 1 per sub-expert respected). Many sub-experts produced no candidate due to measurement dependency (marketing and sales lenses largely deferred under improve-data for pre-L1 businesses).

**Deepening pass:** Top 9 candidates selected (within per-business cap). 1 candidate (BRIK equipment maintenance) excluded as lowest impact.

**Cap enforcement:** No divergence overflow observed. Per-business deepening caps: BRIK(2), PIPE(2), XA(1), HEAD(1), PET(1), HBAG(1), cross-cutting(1) = 9 total.

## 6. Depth Gate

- Pass rate: 9/9 deepened candidates include Evidence-Pointers (>=2), Falsification-Test, and First-Signal.
- DGP reroutes from depth gate: 0.
- Hunch reroutes from depth gate: 0 (BRIK maintenance scored low at confidence gate, not depth gate).

## 7. Confidence Gate

- **Presentable (5/5):** 7
- **Decision-gap (3-4/5):** 1 (BRIK guest satisfaction survey — customer identified but OTA review sufficiency unknown)
- **Hunches (0-2/5):** 1 (BRIK equipment maintenance tracking — assumed problem without evidence, not persisted)

## 8. Assumption Challenge (F3)

Assumptions-Source was `none` for this run. No assumption verdicts required.

## 9. Clustering

- **1 cluster formed:** PIPE-CLU-001 (competitive landscape + product selection scorecard) — same business, same MACRO (Measure), same problem (what to sell).
  - Agreement: Both lafley and finder agree PIPE needs product/market data before infrastructure.
  - Rivalry: None (complementary perspectives).
- **5 singletons:** XA outcome, HEAD outcome, PET category, HBAG outcome, API registration.
- No cross-business merges (hard rule respected). XA/HEAD/PET/HBAG outcome contracts are structurally similar but each is a different business.

## 10. Tool-Gap Register (F2)

| Gap-Type | Missing Tool/Data | Impacted Business | Evidence |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| telemetry | GA4 + Search Console not configured | BRIK | `strategy/BRIK/plan.user.md:22` |
| data | Customer persona + JTBD statement | PIPE, XA, HEAD, PET, HBAG | All pre-L1 plans cite undefined customer |
| data | Outcome contracts (metric + target + deadline) | XA, HEAD, PET, HBAG | All plans cite outcome ambiguity as #1 risk |
| data | Competitive landscape and pricing data | PIPE | `strategy/PIPE/plan.user.md:33` |
| data | Margin proxy / landed cost calculation | PIPE, HBAG | `strategy/PIPE/plan.user.md:80` |
| operational | Agent API business registration | PIPE, XA, HEAD, PET, HBAG | API returns 3/8 businesses |
| reliability | Build/CI baseline timing | PLAT | `strategy/PLAT/plan.user.md:64` |
| governance | Sweep-to-delivery conversion metrics | BOS | `strategy/BOS/plan.user.md:72` |

## 11. Contrarian Gate

- **PASS:** 6 (all presentable ideas that entered filter)
- **UNRESOLVED:** 0
- **FAIL:** 0

All ideas passed because they target fundamental measurement gaps. The contrarian steelman ("analysis paralysis") was addressed: all ideas are time-boxed (7-14 day signal), low-cost, and fully reversible.

## 12. Munger/Buffett Filter

- **Promoted:** 6
- **Held:** 0
- **Killed:** 0

Kill rate: 0%. Below the 10% aspirational target. Rationale: all 7 presentable ideas target measurement-first under improve-data stance. No idea was outside circle of competence, all have bounded downside, and all pass inversion test. The 1 hunch was already filtered at Stage 2.

## 13. Kill/Hold Rationale (F4)

No kills or holds in this sweep. The DGP (BRIK guest satisfaction survey) was classified at Stage 2 (confidence gate), not killed at Stage 4.

**DGP detail:**
- **BRIK Guest Satisfaction Survey** | Gap-Type: data | VOI: 0.4 | Decision-Blocked: whether OTA reviews provide sufficient guest feedback or a separate mechanism is needed | Re-evaluate-When: after GA4 is configured and first 30 days of analytics data shows whether OTA review sentiment is accessible | Owner: Pete | Restart condition: GA4 live + OTA review data assessed

## 14. Drucker/Porter Priority

| Priority | Idea | Business | Impact-Band | Plan Target | Sales-Link |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **P1** | Product Selection + Competitive Landscape | PIPE | M | L1 Foundation: validate fulfillment path | Direct: first product → first sale |
| **P2** | XA Outcome Contract | XA | M | Outcome Contract Definition | Direct: defines first commercial target |
| **P2** | Register Missing Businesses in API | cross-cutting | S | BOS coordination | Indirect: enables complete sweeps for revenue businesses |
| **P3** | HEAD Outcome Contract | HEAD | M | First Outcome Lock-In | Direct: defines first testable offer |
| **P3** | PET Category Lock + Margin | PET | M | Outcome Contract Setup | Direct: locks first category bet |
| **P3** | HBAG Standalone Outcome | HBAG | M | Separate Identity from XA | Direct: enables independent validation |

**Distribution:** P1: 1, P2: 2, P3: 3, P4: 0, P5: 0

**Enabler idea gate (API registration):**
- Enabled-Business: all revenue businesses (PIPE, XA, HEAD, PET, HBAG)
- Sales-Blocker: sweep data incomplete for 5 revenue businesses
- Unblock-SLA: next sweep run

## 15. Economics + Sales Readiness Gate (F5)

All 6 promoted ideas pass economics gate:

| Idea | Upside | Downside | Reversibility | Cost-of-Delay | Time-to-Signal | Gate |
|------|--------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|------|
| PIPE product selection | Prevents wrong product build | 1-2 wk research | Fully reversible | High | 14 days | PASS |
| XA outcome contract | Focused execution | 1 day writing | Fully reversible | High | 7 days | PASS |
| API registration | Complete sweep data | 1 hour dev | Fully reversible | Low-medium | 1 day | PASS |
| HEAD outcome contract | Focused execution | 1 day writing | Fully reversible | Medium | 7 days | PASS |
| PET category lock | Prevents dilution | 1-2 days | Fully reversible | Medium | 14 days | PASS |
| HBAG outcome | Independent validation | 1 day writing | Fully reversible | Medium | 7 days | PASS |

**Sales-readiness gate:** Not applicable (no ideas claim launch readiness).

## 16. Cards Created / Preview (Dry-Run)

**Persistence mode: dry-run — no cards created.**

| Would-Create Card | Business | Priority | Impact-Band |
|-------------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Product Selection + Competitive Landscape Scorecard | PIPE | P1 | M |
| XA Outcome Contract Definition | XA | P2 | M |
| Register Missing Businesses in Agent API | BOS (cross-cutting) | P2 | S |
| HEAD Outcome Contract + Offer Definition | HEAD | P3 | M |
| PET Category Lock + Margin Baseline | PET | P3 | M |
| HBAG Standalone Outcome Contract | HBAG | P3 | M |

**Would-create ideas (not card-eligible):**
- BRIK Guest Satisfaction Survey (DGP, Gap-Type: data, VOI: 0.4)

## 17. Fact-Find Seeding / Preview (Dry-Run)

**Global Top-K (K=3) — newly promoted ideas only:**

| Rank | Card | Business | Priority | Impact-Band | Template | Reason |
|------|------|----------|----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Product Selection + Competitive Landscape | PIPE | P1 | M | Standard | Highest priority; direct sales unblock |
| 2 | XA Outcome Contract | XA | P2 | M | Standard | Second priority; foundational for XA |
| 3 | Register Missing Businesses in API | BOS | P2 | S | Standard | Third by priority; unblocks sweep completeness |

**Persistence mode: dry-run — no fact-find docs created.**

## 18. Existing Card Addenda

No existing cards were promoted by this sweep (all new ideas). Reaffirmations of prior sweep ideas are recorded in Section 4.

## 19. Technical Cabinet

**Status:** Triggered (stance is `improve-data`).

**Finding:** 5 businesses not registered in Agent API.

| Idea | applies_to | Lens | Impact |
|------|-----------|------|--------|
| Register Missing Businesses in API | `["cross-cutting"]` | code-review | Enables complete sweep coverage |

**No diff artifact found** at `docs/business-os/engineering/repo-diff.user.md` or `docs/business-os/engineering/diffs/`. Technical cabinet ran static repo hygiene checks only.

## 20. DGPs Created (Preview)

| DGP | Business | Gap-Type | VOI | Decision-Blocked | Re-evaluate-When | Owner |
|-----|----------|----------|-----|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Guest Satisfaction Survey | BRIK | data | 0.4 | Whether OTA reviews suffice | After GA4 live + 30 days data | Pete |

## 21. DGP Resurfacing

**Ready-now:** 0 (no existing DGP backlog in API — ideas endpoint returned 0 ideas).
**Watch:** 0.

Note: Prior sweep DGPs were dry-run only and not persisted to the API. They remain as report-level artifacts in the 2026-02-10 sweep.

## 22. Persistence Accounting (Dry-Run)

| Entity Type | Would-Create | Created | Failed |
|-------------|-------------|---------|--------|
| Ideas | 7 | 0 | 0 |
| Cards | 6 | 0 | 0 |
| Fact-Find Docs | 3 | 0 | 0 |

**Total API write attempts: 0** (dry-run mode enforced).

- Manifest: `docs/business-os/sweeps/2026-02-11-commit-manifest.json` (16 operations)
- Ledger: `docs/business-os/sweeps/2026-02-11-write-ledger.jsonl` (16 would_create entries)
- Card ID Map: `docs/business-os/sweeps/2026-02-11-card-id-map.json` (6 null entries)

## 23. Reconciliation Checklist

Not applicable (dry-run, no persistence failures, run status = complete).

## 24. Context Discipline

**Status:** Full
**Coverage ratio:** 12/12 sub-experts (100%). BRIK received additional brikette lens coverage.
**Degradation:** None.

## 25. Signal Quality

- **Presentable rate:** 78% (7/9 deepened candidates)
- **Contrarian unresolved rate:** 0% (0/6 filtered ideas)
- **Evidence density:** 2.4 pointers per candidate (average)

High presentable rate reflects well-documented measurement gaps. Zero unresolved rate indicates straightforward measurement tasks. Evidence density adequate but would increase with live analytics data.

## 26. Delta/Coverage (F6)

**Comparison vs prior sweep (2026-02-10):**

| Metric | 2026-02-10 | 2026-02-11 | Delta |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Businesses audited | 4 | 8 | +4 |
| Sub-expert coverage | 100% | 100% | = |
| Candidates raw | 12 | 11 | -1 |
| Candidates deepened | 8 | 9 | +1 |
| Presentable | 6 | 7 | +1 |
| Decision-gap | 2 | 1 | -1 |
| Promoted | 4 | 6 | +2 |
| Held | 2 | 0 | -2 |
| Killed | 0 | 0 | = |
| Reaffirmations | 2 | 5 | +3 |

**Key deltas:**
- 4 new businesses now covered (XA, HEAD, PET, HBAG). Each produced 1 outcome-contract idea.
- Prior sweep's 4 promoted ideas all reaffirmed. No regressions.
- Prior sweep's 2 held DGPs remain valid but unpersisted.

No heartbeat gaps >90s observed.

## 29. API Preflight Mode

**Mode:** strict
**Fallback trigger:** None (API responded 200)
**Dedup confidence:** Full (49 existing cards checked, 0 ideas, 0 stage-docs)
**Note:** API businesses endpoint returns only 3 of 8 businesses. PIPE cards exist via cards endpoint but PIPE is not in businesses list. Sweep used union of API + filesystem data.
