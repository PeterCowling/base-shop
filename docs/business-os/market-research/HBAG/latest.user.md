# HBAG Market Intelligence — Latest

## MARKET-04 — Channel landscape (current)

`docs/business-os/market-research/HBAG/market-04-channel-landscape.user.md`

**Status: Draft** — Created 2026-02-23.
Key finding: Etsy Day 1 + TikTok/Instagram organic discovery is the 90-day channel stack.
Pinterest at Day 30 for evergreen support. Tourist channel (Positano boutique + Brikette hostel)
seasonal June–Sept parallel. TikTok Shop optional Day 60+ only after Etsy traction proven.
Critical constraint: US de minimis suspension (20 Feb 2026 executive order) creates duty friction
for US-bound orders — treat carrier choice and duty disclosure as conversion variables, not logistics detail.

## MARKET-03 — Pricing benchmarks

`docs/business-os/market-research/HBAG/market-03-pricing-benchmarks.user.md`

**Status: Draft** — Created 2026-02-23.
Key finding: Etsy's volume cliff sits at ~$79–$80 (high-velocity artisan-premium band). Above $100,
conversion is viability-proven but requires "art object" framing (favourites > reviews). H1 recommended
launch price: €99. H2 recommended launch price: €89 (framed as micro-bag charm, not tech cover).
Amalfi tourist channel range: €110–€140 H1 / €90–€120 H2. Italian-leather + brass claims are
commoditised on Etsy — photography and craft proof are the true differentiators at €95–€120.

## MARKET-02 — Demand evidence

`docs/business-os/market-research/HBAG/market-02-demand-evidence.user.md`

**Status: Draft** — Created 2026-02-23.
Key finding: bag charm trend active but maturing — shifting from novelty/character to craft/texture-led
executions. Etsy shows active buyer intent signals (favourites, "in carts", "low stock") on charm-adjacent
listings. AirPods case category commoditised (3,000+ Etsy items, mostly below $50). Apple AirPods Pro 3
released Sep 2025 — Q1 2026 demand may be tail of that wave. Amalfi tourist season June–September confirmed.

## MARKET-01 — Competitor mapping

`docs/business-os/market-research/HBAG/market-01-competitor-mapping.user.md`

**Status: Draft** — 10 competitors mapped (7 Etsy-native, 3 DTC). Created 2026-02-23.
Key finding: mini handbag-shaped charms on Etsy cluster <$30; premium €80–€150 bag charm space
is dominated by bag jewellery (pearls/chains) and leather tech cases — not handbag-silhouette charms.
This is both a competitive risk (cheap lookalikes) and a price/quality wedge opportunity.

## Prior baseline

`docs/business-os/market-research/HBAG/2026-02-20-market-intelligence.user.md`

**Status: Superseded** — S2 backfill from `mini-handbag-pmf` fact-find (2026-02-17). Still valid
for H1/H2 market signals; now supplemented by MARKET-01 and MARKET-02 above.
