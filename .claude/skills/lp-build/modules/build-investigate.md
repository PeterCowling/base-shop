# Build Executor: INVESTIGATE

## Objective

Produce the investigation artifact (decision memo, analysis note, evidence map) that closes the task's uncertainty.

## Workflow

1. Execute investigation steps in task acceptance.
2. Gather evidence via read-only commands/docs.
3. Produce deliverable artifact at planned path.
4. Validate against task acceptance criteria.
5. Update plan task status and notes.

## Constraints

- No production implementation work.
- If investigation reveals unresolved execution uncertainty, add notes and route to `/lp-replan`.
