# PRODUCTS-07 — Caryina Aggregate Product Pack

> Pre-launch aggregate. Performance baseline (03), PMF signals (05), and roadmap snapshot (06) will be added post-launch.

---

## A. Product Line Summary

**Architecture:** All Caryina products share one physical form — the "Mini Facade Micro Bag" — a structured micro handbag with turn-lock clasp, dual top handles, side gussets, and (on select colorways) a three-arched-window facade applique.

**Launch SKUs:** 6 (2 functions × 3 colorways)

| SKU | Function | Colorway | Price | Launch Status |
|-----|----------|----------|-------|--------------|
| H1-V1 | Bag Charm | Silver metallic (reptile emboss, facade) | €89 | **Launch** — lead hero |
| H1-V2 | Bag Charm | White/pink splatter (croc emboss) | €89 | **Launch** |
| H1-V3 | Bag Charm | Peach/salmon (pebbled grain, facade) | €89 | **Launch** |
| H2-V1 | AirPods Holder | Silver metallic | €119 | **Launch** |
| H2-V2 | AirPods Holder | White/pink splatter | €119 | **Launch** |
| H2-V3 | AirPods Holder | Peach/salmon | €119 | **Launch** |

**Deferred products:**

| Code | Product | Gate | Priority |
|------|---------|------|----------|
| H3 | Amalfi Location Variant | Supplier graphic capability | 3 (seasonal Jun–Sep) |
| H4 | Dog Poop Bag Holder | Post-checkpoint | 4 |
| H5 | Children's First Bag | GPSR + REACH (~€1–3K) | 5 |

## B. Competitive Landscape

### Market structure

Etsy shows 5,000+ items for "Bag Charms," "Mini Bag Charms," and "Airpods Case." The environment is extremely crowded with a low-cost noise floor ($5–$15 novelties and digital patterns) that compresses perceived value. Caryina's structured handbag silhouette at €89–€119 occupies a genuine white space — no Etsy competitor sells a structured micro-handbag-shaped charm at this price point.

### Price ladder

| Tier | Band | Key Players |
|------|------|------------|
| Novelty | $5–$15 | Faux leather mini purse charms; resin shapes; digital patterns |
| Budget craft | $15–$40 | Leather AirPods cases with keychain; simple leather charms |
| Mid-market artisan | $50–$80 | SexylittleVintage ($69–$79), YLSecretHeart (~$77), TRIMleather ($70), NitmoiStudio ($55+) |
| **Premium artisan** | **$80–$120** | **Caryina H1 (€89) / H2 (€119)**, SPECSET (~$104), PEGAI ($99) |
| Accessible luxury brand | €95–€225 | Coach bag charms |
| Luxury brand | €290–€1,900 | Fendi Nano Baguette Charm (€670+), Dior, Hermès AirPods ($1,125–$1,625) |

### Core competitive advantages

1. **Architectural uniqueness** — no competitor has the structured micro-handbag form with turn-lock hardware
2. **Cross-function versatility** — same body serves as charm (H1) and tech holder (H2)
3. **Facade applique as brand signature** — three-arched-window motif is unique and recognisable
4. **EU-based shipping** — PEGAI (strongest H2 competitor at $99) is US-only
5. **Price anchoring** — €89 undercuts Coach (€95); €119 is accessible vs Hermès ($1,625)

### Core vulnerabilities

1. **Zero reviews** — every competitor has hundreds to thousands
2. **Material ambiguity** — substrate unconfirmed; "leather-look" is not a premium claim
3. **Attachment hardware gap** — no clip/carabiner visible in product photos (P0 blocker)
4. **Price justification** — H2 at €119 is 70% above TRIMleather ($70) and 20% above PEGAI ($99)

## C. Bundle and Packaging Strategy

### Launch bundles (Day 1)

| Bundle | Contents | Price | Gross Margin (base Etsy) | Margin (w/ Offsite Ads) |
|--------|----------|-------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Single H1 | 1 bag charm | €89 | 49.5% | 34.3% |
| Single H2 | 1 AirPods holder | €119 | 59.5% | 44.3% |
| The Pair | H1 + H2 matched colorway | €189 | 52.0% | 36.5% |
| Gift-H1 | H1 + gift packaging | €99 | 50.5% | 35.3% |
| Gift-H2 | H2 + gift packaging | €129 | 59.5% | 44.3% |

### Deferred bundles

| Bundle | Trigger | Price |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Collector Set (3×H1) | After first 10 sales | €239 (margin-tight with Offsite Ads at 29.6% — may need €249) |
| Mix-and-Match | Demand signals for cross-colorway pairing | €189 |

### Packaging format

- **Standard:** rigid card box (warm near-white), strawberry milk pink tissue, care card with QR code. ~€4/unit.
- **Gift:** standard + sage satin ribbon + blank gift card + gift receipt. ~€5/unit.
- **Shipping:** rigid mailer, crinkle paper padding. ~€2–3/unit.
- **Fully loaded unit cost:** ~€39 (€35 target COGS + ~€4 packaging), within margin targets at both price points.

## D. Etsy Fee Economics

Italy-based Etsy shop fee stack: transaction 6.5% + processing 4% + €0.30 + regulatory 0.32% = **~10.82% + €0.30 base**. Offsite Ads add 15% for shops under $10K trailing.

| Scenario | H1 (€89) Net | H1 Margin | H2 (€119) Net | H2 Margin | Pair (€189) Net | Pair Margin |
|----------|-------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Base Etsy | €79.07 | 49.5% | €105.83 | 59.5% | €168.26 | 52.0% |
| With Offsite Ads | €65.56 | 34.3% | €87.76 | 44.3% | €139.04 | 36.5% |

**Key finding:** H1 at €89 with Offsite Ads sits at the margin floor (34.3% vs 35% target). H2 and Pair bundles have comfortable margin throughout. H2 is the most margin-resilient SKU.

## E. Demand Context

### Trend status (Q1 2026)

Bag charms are not a fading trend but an **evolving category** — shifting from novelty/character overload toward refined, texture-led, craft-authenticity executions (MARKET-02). This pivot directly favours Caryina's positioning: "one considered charm that elevates the bag."

### Key demand signals

- Etsy shows active buyer intent: "in carts," "low stock," and favourites on charm-adjacent listings
- TikTok #BagCharms: 21,700+ posts (2024 Vogue); bag charms = "top-trending product"
- Coach bag charms at €95 validate accessible-premium pricing
- Fendi Nano Baguette Charm validates "nano-bag as charm" architecture at €670+
- AirPods Pro 3 released Sep 2025 — Q1 2026 accessory demand is live

### Buyer psychology

- **H1 purchase logic:** personalisation + style expression; "chaotic customisation" impulse; 3–7 day consideration at €80–€150
- **H2 purchase logic:** compatibility assurance + everyday carry; "fits AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4" is the primary conversion driver
- **Gift logic:** strong for both — milestone gifts, Christmas, Mother's Day; Etsy sellers already optimise for gift occasions

## F. Compliance and Platform Constraints

| Constraint | Status | Impact |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| EU GPSR (2023/988) | Applies from Dec 2024 | Risk assessment, traceability, responsible person documentation required |
| REACH (metal hardware) | Nickel + chromium VI limits | Supplier must confirm REACH compliance on clasps and rings |
| Apple trademark | Guidance published | Use "AirPods Pro 2" numeric naming; no endorsement implication; no "Made for" marks |
| Etsy seller policy | Reviewed | Original design with disclosed production partner is compliant; reselling/drop-shipping prohibited |
| EU €3 duty on <€150 parcels | From July 2026 | Affects Etsy international shipping economics from summer 2026 |
| IP/trade dress (Birkin silhouette) | Risk flagged | Fashion-accessory framing; avoid exact replica claim; never use "Birkin" in copy |

---

## G. P0 Blockers (must resolve before listing)

| Blocker | Why | Owner |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Unit cost + MOQ from supplier (TASK-02) | Margin stack for all SKUs depends on ~€35 COGS target | Pete |
| Attachment hardware (clip/carabiner) | Cannot list H1 as "bag charm" without visible attachment; not shown in any photos | Pete |
| Photography perception test (TASK-06 VC-01) | Gate: ≥3/5 cold reviewers must estimate ≥€80 for H1 lead photo | Pete |
| Material substrate confirmation | "Leather-look" is not a premium listing claim; competitors say "full-grain Italian leather" | Pete |

---
