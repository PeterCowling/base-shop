# Ideas Readiness — HEAD Outcome Contract Fact-Find

## Scope
Capture and lock the exact outcome contract needed for the Headband business to guide idea prioritization and weekly keep/pivot/scale decisions.

## Evidence Audit (Current State)

- HEAD outcome contract is now explicitly locked in the canonical strategy file.
  - `docs/business-os/strategy/HEAD/plan.user.md`
- Forecast and intake artifacts align to the same 90-day target window and guardrail logic.
  - `docs/business-os/strategy/HEAD/headband-90-day-launch-forecast-v2.user.md`
  - `docs/business-os/startup-baselines/HEAD-forecast-seed.user.md`

## Locked Contract Snapshot (HEAD)

| Field | Locked value |
|---|---|
| Outcome-ID | `HEAD-OUT-2026Q1-01` |
| Outcome | Achieve first reliable direct sales in Italy, then stabilize weekly sales with controlled CAC and returns |
| Baseline | 2026-02-12: orders 0, net revenue EUR 0, CAC/returns unmeasured |
| Target | 110 net orders and EUR 3,000 net revenue |
| By | 2026-05-13 |
| Owner | Pete |
| Weekly leading indicators | Sessions, CVR, paid CAC, blended CAC, payment success, return rate |
| Decision-Link | `DEC-HEAD-01` |
| Stop/Pivot Threshold | Enforced thresholds are codified in the HEAD strategy plan |

## Remaining Weak Gaps (Post-Lock)

| Gap | Why it still matters | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Exact sellable units + in-stock date confirmation | Needed to make spend pacing decision-grade | Pete |
| Final launch pricing architecture | Needed to stress-test CAC and contribution guardrails | Pete |
| Payment day-1 readiness evidence | Needed before scaling traffic | Pete |

## Planning Readiness Gate

- [x] HEAD outcome contract is complete in `docs/business-os/strategy/HEAD/plan.user.md`.
- [x] Decision link and stop/pivot thresholds are explicit and measurable.
- [x] Weekly leading indicators are defined with enforceable guardrails.
