The one that makes hostel arrivals easiest is **Chiesa Nuova / Bar Internazionale** — it’s the closest stop to Hostel Brikette and avoids walking much further from the Positano Sponda bus stop, or long stair climbs you’ll face if you somehow end up at the “Positano Centro” bus stop.",
        "From this stop it’s a short, mostly flat walk (about 120–140 metres) plus the hostel entrance steps. That’s why we recommend it for **luggage**, **tired legs**, and **first‑time arrivals**.",
        "If you’re planning your broader arrival, see our %LINK:howToGetToPositano|How to get to Positano% guide, then use this page for the final stop and the last 2–5 minutes on foot."
