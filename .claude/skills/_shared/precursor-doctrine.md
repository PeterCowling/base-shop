# Precursor Doctrine

Unknowns must become explicit tasks, not inline notes.

## Rule

If an IMPLEMENT task cannot be promoted safely, create precursor tasks (`INVESTIGATE` or `SPIKE`) with explicit acceptance and dependencies.

## Example Chain

- TASK-54 (INVESTIGATE): decision memo resolves approach uncertainty
- TASK-55 (SPIKE): prototype resolves implementation uncertainty
- TASK-51 (IMPLEMENT): confidence remains conditional until TASK-54 and TASK-55 complete
