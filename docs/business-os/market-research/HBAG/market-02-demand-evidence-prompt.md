# MARKET-02 Deep Research Prompt — Caryina (HBAG) Demand Evidence

## Context for the research agent

**Business:** Caryina — premium artisan bag accessories brand, Positano, Italy.
**Products under demand test:**
- **H1 — Bag charm:** Birkin-style mini handbag worn on handbag strap. Target price €95–€120.
- **H2 — AirPod holder:** Same body; sized for AirPods Pro / AirPods 4 with clip. Target price €80–€100.

**Primary channel:** Etsy. Secondary discovery: Instagram / TikTok organic.

**What MARKET-01 (competitor mapping) established — do NOT re-derive these:**
- Premium mini handbag-silhouette charms are a gap on Etsy at €80–€150; existing premium bag charm spend concentrates in bag jewellery (pearls/chains) and leather tech cases.
- Closest shape competitors (YLSecretHeart, TyransLeatherShop) price at $72–$89 — below Caryina's target.
- Biggest H2 threat: PEGAI ($99, 107k sales) but EU-shipping blocked.
- The bag charm trend is confirmed multi-source (JOOR 12× wholesale growth H1 2025; Pinterest +700%). This is prior-researched context.
- 2026 aesthetic direction: craft authenticity, vintage-inspired, no logos, natural textures.

**What MARKET-02 must establish (research gaps):**
- Is search-level demand for bag charms / mini bag accessories still growing or plateauing as of Q1 2026? (JOOR and Pinterest data are from mid-2025 — needs a current read.)
- Is there observable Etsy-side demand specifically for handbag-silhouette charms at premium price (i.e., buyers searching for this, not just buying what's available)? Proxies: Etsy search autocomplete suggestions, "bestseller" badge distribution in the category, wishlist/favourite counts.
- Are there Reddit, TikTok, Instagram, or forum discussions where buyers are expressing unfilled demand for "the right bag charm" at €80–€150? (Qualitative pull signals — buyer voice, not trend data.)
- Is the bag charm trend showing any signs of saturation or backlash in Q1 2026?
- What does Etsy-side demand look like for leather AirPod cases at €80–€100? Is that category growing or being squeezed by case-maker commoditisation?
- For the secondary ICP (Amalfi tourist, June–Sept): is there observable demand for premium artisan souvenirs in Positano / Amalfi Coast tourist retail? Any trend data on Italian artisan souvenir spend in 2025–26?

## Research Objectives

Produce decision-grade demand evidence for Caryina's 90-day Etsy demand test. The goal is to confirm (or challenge) the assumption that latent buyer demand exists at €80–€150 for a handbag-silhouette bag charm with an Italian artisan story — not just that "bag charms are trending" (already confirmed), but that buyers are *searching* for premium options and expressing frustration with current alternatives.

## Required Output Sections

### Section 1 — Demand Indicators

For each indicator type below, provide specific data points with source and confidence tag:

**Search signals:**
- Google Trends trajectory for "bag charm", "mini bag charm", "handbag charm", "Birkin bag charm" — direction (rising/flat/declining) as of Q1 2026, and peak index value vs. current.
- Etsy search autocomplete: what related terms appear when searching "bag charm", "leather bag charm", "mini bag"? List the top 5–8 autocomplete suggestions — these reveal active buyer intent vocabulary.
- Pinterest trend trajectory for bag charm / mini bag accessory searches (Q4 2025 → Q1 2026). Note: prior research showed +700% growth — is that holding, accelerating, or reversing?

**Social signals:**
- TikTok: estimated view count for #bagcharm, #bagcharms, #bagjewelry, #minibaggcharm hashtags. Note if any TikTok creators have produced viral content (>500k views) on bag charms or "bag accessory styling" in Q4 2025 – Q1 2026.
- Instagram: hashtag volume for #bagcharm, #bagcharms, #handbagjewelry, #bagtok. Note any editorial accounts or fashion influencers consistently covering the category.
- Any "bag charm haul" or "bag charm styling" content format gaining traction — this signals buyer intent is moving beyond passive trend watching into active purchase/styling behaviour.

**Marketplace signals:**
- Etsy: which bag charm / bag accessory subcategory shows the most "bestseller" badges in the €60–€150 range? Is it jewellery charms, leather charms, or novelty/character charms?
- Etsy: are premium listings (€80+) showing "low in stock" or "X sold in the last 24 hours" indicators? Name specific examples where observable.
- Are there any Etsy buyer forum posts, community threads, or "what to buy" editorial lists recommending specific bag charm shops? These are strong pull signals.

**Forum / review signals:**
- Reddit: search r/femalefashionadvice, r/handbags, r/buyitforlife for "bag charm" discussions. What are buyers saying they want? What are they complaining about with current options? Quote directly where possible.
- TikTok/Instagram comment sections on bag charm content: are there comments expressing "where can I buy this?", "I've been looking for something like this", "finally a premium option"?

### Section 2 — Segment-Level Pull Signals and Urgency Cues

Address each ICP separately:

**ICP-A — The Bag Charm Buyer (Women 27–42, aspirational handbag owners):**
- Is there evidence this specific segment (not general fashion buyers) is actively searching for bag charm options? Look for: Pinterest board names that combine "handbag styling" with "bag charms", Instagram saves/shares patterns, "what to buy" lists in fashion editorial aimed at this demo.
- What urgency cues exist? Trend lifecycle position (is this "early majority" or "late majority" adoption?), seasonal gifting spikes (Christmas/Mother's Day/Valentine's), social FOMO triggers.

**ICP-B — Gift buyers:**
- Are bag charms / mini bag accessories showing up in "luxury gift under €100/€150" gift guide editorial? (Who What Wear, Vogue, Glamour, InStyle, Harper's Bazaar gift guides for 2025 Christmas or 2026 Valentine's Day)
- Any observable gifting-intent signals on Etsy (gift message rates, listing saves in November/December)?

**ICP-C — Amalfi tourist (June–Sept):**
- Is there observable interest in "artisan souvenirs Positano", "luxury shopping Amalfi Coast", "Italian leather accessories Amalfi" in search or travel content?
- Any travel editorial recommending artisan shopping in Positano / Amalfi area specifically for fashion accessories?

### Section 3 — Seasonality and Timing Effects

- When does bag charm / bag accessory search volume peak annually? (Holiday gifting? Spring "new season bag" refresh? Back-to-school? Summer travel?)
- For Etsy-native artisan accessories, are there observable demand spikes around specific dates (Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, Christmas) based on seller patterns, editorial recommendations, or seller forum guidance?
- For H2 (AirPod holder): does demand correlate with Apple product release cycles (new AirPods launch = new case buyers)? When were AirPods Pro 3 / AirPods 4 released and what is the current installed base context?
- For H3 (Amalfi tourist): confirm the June–September tourist season window. Is there any evidence of earlier or later peaks that would affect boutique outreach timing?

### Section 4 — Counter-Signals (Weak Demand or Saturation Warnings)

- Is there any evidence the bag charm trend is in decline as of Q1 2026? Look for: "is the bag charm trend over?" editorial, declining Google Trends, reduced Pinterest engagement, fashion forecasters noting the trend as "peaked".
- Are there signs of category commoditisation — i.e., fast fashion brands (Zara, H&M, ASOS) releasing €10–€20 bag charms that could undercut the premium tier's "trend entry" rationale?
- For H2: is the leather AirPod case category becoming saturated on Etsy? (If there are 10,000+ listings with many at $40–$60, the price floor may be harder to hold at €80+.)
- Any Etsy seller forum signals of declining organic search traffic to bag charm / bag accessory listings in Q4 2025 – Q1 2026?

### Section 5 — Confidence Scoring and Evidence Log

For each major claim in Sections 1–4, provide:

| Claim | Source | Evidence type | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| [claim] | [URL or publication] | Observed / Inferred / Assumption | High / Medium / Low |

Flag as **Assumption** where no direct evidence was found but the claim is logically inferred from adjacent data.
Flag as **Gap** where the information would materially change the demand picture but could not be sourced.

## Scope Constraints

- **Primary lens: Etsy + social search (TikTok, Instagram, Pinterest).** These are Caryina's actual demand channels for the 90-day test.
- **Secondary lens: fashion editorial and Reddit.** These surface buyer voice and gift guide inclusion.
- **Do NOT** produce a general "fashion accessories market size" analysis — TAM figures are not useful here. Focus on observable, channel-specific demand signals.
- **Geography:** EU + North America primary; Italy secondary for tourist ICP.
- **Time horizon:** Prioritise Q4 2025 – Q1 2026 signals. Note any material changes from the mid-2025 baseline already on record.

## Prior research on file (do not repeat — extend or challenge)

The following demand signals are already documented in `docs/business-os/market-research/HBAG/2026-02-20-market-intelligence.user.md`:
- JOOR wholesale: 12× bag charm sales growth H1 2025
- Pinterest: +700% search growth for bag charms (mid-2025)
- Coach bag charm $95 as accessible-luxury anchor
- Hermes $930 / Chanel $950 as ultra-luxury ceiling for H2
- Amalfi Coast: 2.3M annual visitors; fashion/accessories = 12.2% Italy tourist spend

Your job is to **update, extend, or challenge** these with Q1 2026 data — not repeat them.
