# HEAD 90-Day Launch Forecast (v2)

## Input Packet

- Business: HEAD
- Idea: products for people with cochlear implants
- Product: headbands to hold cochlear implants in place
- Target customer (initial): people with cochlear implants
- Channel: own site (primary)
- Budget constraint: stock already purchased; ad budget to be derived from TAM and market data
- Stock timeline: inventory already purchased (near-term launch-ready)
- Horizon: 90 days

## Launch Surface Mode

- Mode used in this run: `website-live`
- Metric set used: sessions, conversion, orders, revenue, margin, CAC

## A) Executive Summary

1. Best available published estimate found for Italy is ~17,000 cochlear-implant users (0.03% of population).
2. Italy has annual new-user flow: one Italian clinical overview reports ~1,400 cochlear implants and auditory brainstem implants in 2022.
3. Direct Italian ecommerce competitors sell retention headbands in roughly EUR 18.00-EUR 28.80; adjacent EU sellers reach EUR 12.00.
4. Most practical initial ICP is parents/caregivers of children ~6 months-6 years where retention need is explicit in competitor positioning.
5. Secondary ICPs after initial validation: school-age children and active adults (sport/movement retention use cases).
6. Directional owned-site conversion benchmark for Italy cited in research: ~0.90%-2.2%.
7. Italy return incidence benchmark cited: 5.7% average; 7.4% apparel/sport/accessories; 5.5% health/wellbeing.
8. Paid acquisition economics are tight for low-AOV single-SKU launch; use paid for precision learning, not brute-force scale.
9. With small TAM, niche awareness can be saturated with modest budget, but cold paid cannot be primary growth engine unless AOV/repeat behavior improves.
10. Multiple payment methods are required for conversion hygiene in Italy.
11. EU/Italy distance-selling withdrawal rights (14 days) must be treated as mandatory operating baseline.
12. Forecast scenarios must be recalibrated with week-1/week-2 measured data before any scale decision.
13. Canonical contract authority is `docs/business-os/contracts/HEAD/outcome-contract.user.md`; this forecast is decision support and does not redefine target/CAC contract values.

## C) 90-Day Forecast Table (P10/P50/P90)

Scope note: 90-day window assumed from 2026-02-12.

| Metric (90-day total) | P10 | P50 | P90 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Paid ad spend (EUR) | 600 | 1,500 | 2,500 |
| Paid CPC (EUR/click) | 0.60 | 0.55 | 0.45 |
| Paid sessions | 1,000 | 2,727 | 5,556 |
| Organic/partner sessions | 1,200 | 3,500 | 6,000 |
| Total sessions | 2,200 | 6,227 | 11,556 |
| Paid conversion rate | 1.2% | 2.0% | 2.4% |
| Organic conversion rate | 1.0% | 1.8% | 1.95% |
| Total orders (gross) | 24.0 | 117.5 | 250.3 |
| Return rate | 8.0% | 6.0% | 4.5% |

| Paid CAC (EUR/paid order) | 50.00 | 27.50 | 18.75 |
| Blended CAC (EUR/all orders) | 25.00 | 12.76 | 9.99 |
| Gross profit - ad spend (EUR) | -283 | 404 | 2,707 |

Interpretation notes:
- Base case assumes blended owned-site conversion inside directional Italy benchmark band.
- Return assumptions are anchored to Italian incidence benchmarks and should be re-estimated with observed week-1/week-2 data.
- Paid cost assumptions are directional and require immediate validation.

## D) Proposed Goals (Forecast Alignment)

### Primary ICP recommendation

- Parents/caregivers of children roughly 6 months-6 years with cochlear implants (daily retention need during play/school).

### Secondary ICPs (after first validation loop)

- School-age children with movement/sport use cases.
- Active adults with sport/heat/sweat retention use cases.

### 90-day target alignment

- Canonical target/guardrail source: `docs/business-os/contracts/HEAD/outcome-contract.user.md`
- Forecast alignment: P50 scenario remains aligned to the canonical contract at time of this draft.
- Learning target (forecast-specific): >=6,000 total sessions by day 90, with clean tracking by channel and landing page.
- Effort allocation target (operating posture): preserve ~95/5 split (direct launch execution vs CMS migration).

### Weekly leading indicators

- Traffic: sessions, source mix, landing-page split.
- Funnel: product-page view rate, add-to-cart, checkout start, checkout completion.
- Conversion: weekly CVR and CVR by channel.
- Economics: AOV, paid CAC, gross profit per order net of returns.
- Trust/payment: payment method split and payment success rate.
- Customer insight: weekly conversation count, top objections, top purchase reasons.
- Quality: return reasons, fit issues, compatibility support requests.

## E) Assumptions Register

| Assumption | Evidence type | Confidence | Impact if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| Italy CI user base ~17,000 | Observed (source cited) | High | High |
| Annual new procedure flow ~1,400 (CI + ABI, 2022) | Observed (source cited) | Medium-High | Medium |
| Price band for reachable alternatives ~EUR 12-EUR 28.80 | Observed (sources cited) | High | High |
| Primary ICP should be parents/caregivers under-6 | Inferred from competitor/manufacturer framing | Medium | High |
| Blended CVR realism ~0.90%-2.2% | Observed (secondary benchmark) | Medium | High |
| Return incidence prior in Italy category context | Observed | Medium-High | Medium |
| Paid CPC/CPM priors usable for planning only | Observed but directional | Low-Medium | High |
| Gross margin target range 55%-65% is viable | Inferred with external context | Medium | Medium-High |
| Multiple payment methods are required for conversion | Observed | High | High |
| 14-day withdrawal baseline applies | Observed | High | Medium |
| Awareness moments (Feb 25, Mar 3) can help launch wave | Observed dates + inferred tactical use | Medium | Medium |
| Inventory is near-term launch ready | Given + inferred timing | Medium | High |

## F) Risk Register and Mitigations

| Risk | Why it matters | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Small TAM limits brute-force paid scaling | Niche audience saturates quickly | Use precision paid, partner/community channels, retargeting-first |
| Low-price anchors in market | Downward price pressure | Win via localisation, trust, support, compatibility clarity |
| CAC exceeds gross profit/order | Low-AOV single-SKU fragility | Bundle offers, free-shipping thresholds, hard CAC caps |
| Fit/compatibility confusion | Returns + support burden | Compatibility matrix/quiz, clear visuals, assisted support |
| Payment friction | Conversion loss in checkout | Ship multiple methods day 1; optimize mobile checkout |
| Compliance/claim risk | Trust + legal exposure | Keep positioning on comfort/retention, avoid medical efficacy claims |
| Over-building before launch | Missed speed-to-sales objective | Keep direct-launch focus; CMS remains secondary lane |

## G) First 14-Day Validation Plan

1. Confirm inventory readiness and fulfill `order -> shipped` median <=48h.
2. Ensure multiple payment methods are live and tested end-to-end.
3. Publish clear Italian withdrawal/returns flow aligned to 14-day baseline.
4. Publish compatibility/fit decision aid before scaling paid.
5. Run capped two-channel tests:
   - high-intent paid search
   - paid social retargeting + focused interest tests
6. Track CPC, CVR, paid CAC daily.
7. Decision thresholds (first pass):
   - if paid CAC > gross profit/order for 7 consecutive days, reduce paid to retargeting only
   - if sitewide CVR <0.9% after >=500 sessions, prioritize landing-page and trust fixes before spend increase
8. Tag every return reason from day 1.
9. Use hearing-awareness dates as early content/outreach pulses.

## Confidence and Caveats

- This is a forecast proposal, not observed performance.
- Several market priors are directional and must be replaced with week-1/week-2 measured data.
- Scale decisions should use validated CAC, CVR, return, and payment success thresholds, not benchmark-only assumptions.
