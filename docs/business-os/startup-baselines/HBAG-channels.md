# HBAG Channel Strategy + GTM (S6B Backfill)

## Executive Summary

HBAG will run Etsy as the primary DTC conversion surface, supported by Instagram/TikTok organic
demand probes and a seasonal in-destination trial at Brikette hostel + Positano boutique (H3
Amalfi location variant only). This is a zero-paid-ads launch: organic Etsy search, social
"DM to buy", and in-destination physical placement are the three channels. No own-site, no app,
no paid acquisition until at least 10 Etsy/social sales confirm demand at premium pricing.
GATE-S6B-ACT-01 is explicitly HOLD until first-party demand data arrives from TASK-09 checkpoint.

## 1) Channel Landscape Audit

Scale: 1–5 per dimension. Total = sum (max 15).

| Channel | Customer fit | Cost fit | Speed to signal | Total | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Etsy marketplace | 5 | 5 | 4 | 14 | Best fit: artisan fashion accessories category; no infrastructure needed; trusted platform |
| Instagram organic | 5 | 5 | 4 | 14 | Bag charm trend is Instagram-native; "DM to buy" model established in artisan category |
| TikTok organic | 4 | 5 | 5 | 14 | High organic reach potential for trend content; shorter shelf life per video |
| In-destination Positano | 5 | 4 | 3 | 12 | Operator advantage is unique; low cost (no platform fees); seasonal constraint June–Sept |
| Pinterest | 3 | 4 | 2 | 9 | +700% bag charm growth on Pinterest; discovery not direct sales; slower signal |
| Own-site DTC | 3 | 2 | 2 | 7 | No site exists; build cost and time prohibitive for demand probe phase |
| Wholesale B2B | 3 | 3 | 1 | 7 | JOOR data shows wholesale buyers looking; deferred to post-50 DTC sales |
| Amazon | 2 | 1 | 3 | 6 | Operational overhead; brand story harder to tell; deferred |
| Paid social (Meta/Instagram ads) | 4 | 2 | 4 | 10 | GATE-S6B-ACT-01 HOLD; no paid until first 10 organic sales; over-investment at zero-revenue stage |

## 2) Selected Channels (3) + Rationale

### Channel A: Etsy Marketplace (Primary DTC — H1 + H2)

**Why selected:**
1. No infrastructure required — shop creation is free; listing fee €0.20 each; platform handles payments, VAT, and currency conversion.
2. Active artisan fashion accessories sub-market confirmed: thousands of listings for bag charms, AirPod holders, mini bags — confirming buyer intent exists on the platform.
3. Etsy search discovery allows organic customer acquisition without paid ads — critical for zero-revenue phase.
4. Premium pricing (€80–€150) is achievable on Etsy for artisan brands with strong photography and brand story; comparable sold inventory at €60–€80 exists.
5. Aligns with outcome contract (HBAG-OUT-2026Q1-01) — Etsy analytics give clean view/favourite/add-to-cart/sales funnel data.

**30-day success metrics:**
- H1 listing: ≥20 unique views in first 14 days (TASK-08 VC-02)
- H2 listing: ≥20 unique views in first 14 days (TASK-08 VC-02)
- Combined favourites: ≥5 per listing in first 14 days
- Sales: ≥3 combined orders in first 28 days (TASK-08 VC-01)
- Add-to-cart rate: ≥1 add-to-cart per 20 views

**Channel constraints:**
- Etsy take-rate: ~9.5% (6.5% transaction + ~3% payment processing); must be included in margin stack
- €0.20 listing fee per listing, renewed every 4 months or after sale
- Etsy Ads (optional): €15–30 experiment only if TASK-08 VC-02 fails (views <20/listing in 14 days)
- Shop branding requires brand name decision (TBD — must resolve before shop creation)
- Reviews accumulate slowly on new shops; use handwritten note and responsive messaging to build trust early

**Stop condition:** If 0 sales after 28 days AND zero add-to-carts after 100 cumulative views → assess listing quality (photos, titles, tags) before concluding demand is absent.

### Channel B: Instagram + TikTok Organic (Demand Probe — H1 primary)

**Why selected:**
1. Bag charm trend is primarily Instagram/TikTok-driven — the discovery channel for this exact category.
2. "DM to buy" model is the fastest demand probe: post content, measure DM inquiries, count genuine purchase intent within 2 weeks.
3. Zero cost at launch (organic posts only); no paid promotion needed for demand signal in 2-week window.
4. Separate HBAG account from Brikette hostel account — keeps brands distinct, audience targeted.
5. Feeds Etsy traffic via "link in bio" CTA on every post.

**30-day success metrics (TASK-07 VC-01/VC-02):**
- ≥5 genuine purchase DM inquiries (not just "where did you get that?") within 14 days of first post
- ≥2 of 5 inquirers confirm purchase intent when given the price
- ≥3 posts published within first 7 days of TASK-06 completion
- Impressions: ≥500 per post (benchmark; organic reach on new account is variable)

**Channel constraints:**
- Account for HBAG must be separate from Brikette (Brikette audience = hostel guests; HBAG audience = fashion accessory buyers)
- Confirm account status (new vs. existing) before TASK-07 starts
- If organic reach <200 impressions per post on a new account → consider cross-posting or micro-influencer seeding as a bridge; assess at week-2 checkpoint
- TikTok: shorter content shelf life; use for rapid-fire product demos ("how it looks on your bag"); Instagram: longer-lasting lifestyle content

**Stop condition:** If 0 DM inquiries after 3 posts with ≥200 impressions each → assess post hook/caption quality before concluding social demand is absent.

---

### Channel C: In-Destination Positano (H3 Amalfi Location — Seasonal)

**Why selected:**
1. Operator (Pete) is physically based in Positano — the only HBAG-specific competitive advantage that cannot be replicated by any other brand online.
2. Leather sandal precedent (€100–€250 in Positano) directly validates tourist WTP for artisan fashion accessories in-destination.
3. 2.3M annual Amalfi Coast visitors; fashion/accessories = 12.2% of Italy tourist spend — destination-level demand is confirmed.
4. Low cost: product placed at Brikette reception requires no platform fee; consignment to 1 boutique requires no upfront spend.
5. Differentiates H3 (location variant) from H1/H2 — in-destination-only availability creates scarcity and location story.

**30-day success metrics (TASK-10 VC-01, June–Sept only):**
- ≥5 in-destination sales (hostel + boutique combined) within 4 weeks of trial start
- ≥1 consignment agreement with a Positano boutique

**Channel constraints:**
- Seasonal window: June–September only — requires TASK-09 checkpoint clearance by end of April to enable May boutique outreach
- Boutique consignment terms to negotiate: typically 30–50% split; minimum stock placed; review period
- H3 product requires Amalfi location imagery on bag body — depends on whether supplier can apply custom graphics (Q4 from Pete, currently unverified)
- If supplier cannot apply Amalfi imagery, H3 in-destination trial uses H1 bag charm variant with location story in verbal pitch

**Stop condition:** If 0 boutique agreements after outreach to 3 Positano boutiques → consider Brikette reception only; assess whether in-destination channel is viable as a standalone without boutique distribution.

## 3) Cost / Constraint Analysis

### Month-1 budget allocation (EUR)

| Lane | Allocation | Constraint |
|---|---:|---|
| Etsy setup + listings | €0.40 (2 × €0.20 listing fees) | Fixed; minimal cost |
| Instagram/TikTok content creation | €0 | Pete creates content; no paid creative |
| Etsy Ads (optional, contingency) | €0–30 | Only if TASK-08 VC-02 fails (views <20/listing in 14 days) |
| In-destination product placement | €0 | Brikette reception: zero cost; boutique consignment: zero upfront |
| **Total** | **€0–30** | Zero paid ads until GATE-S6B-ACT-01 clears |

### Resource allocation (hours/week)

| Role | Hours/week | Scope |
|---|---:|---|
| Pete (owner) | 4–6 | Channel decisions, DM responses, weekly demand log update, Etsy shop management |
| Content creation | 2–3 | Instagram/TikTok post creation (Pete); 3 posts per week initially |
| Photography | One-time (TASK-06) | 9+ photos; perception test; not ongoing |
| Boutique outreach (seasonal) | 2–4 (May only) | TASK-10 pre-checkpoint prep |

### Constraints

- No paid-channel activation until GATE-S6B-ACT-01 passes (10 first-party HBAG sales minimum)
- No own-site build until demand is confirmed
- No wholesale/B2B outreach until 50 DTC sales confirmed (too early to scale before signal quality is established)
- H4 (dog holder) and H5 (children's first bag) channels deferred to post-TASK-09 checkpoint

## 4) 30-Day GTM Timeline

| Week | Action | Owner | Channel | Dependency | Milestone |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-launch | Pete gets supplier quote (TASK-02) — confirms margin at target price | Pete | — | — | Price floor confirmed |
| Pre-launch | Photography session (TASK-06) — H1, H2, H3 variants; run perception test | Pete | — | TASK-02 complete | Photos ready; perception test ≥3/5 pass |
| Pre-launch | Decide brand name via `/brand-naming-research` | Pete | — | — | Etsy shop name confirmed |
| Week 1 | Create Etsy shop; publish H1 (bag charm) and H2 (AirPod holder) listings | Pete | Etsy | Photos ready; name decided | Listings live and indexed |
| Week 1 | Create HBAG Instagram + TikTok accounts (separate from Brikette) | Pete | Social | — | Accounts live |
| Week 1 | Post #1: H1 bag charm on real handbag strap (context shot with "DM to buy" CTA) | Pete | Instagram + TikTok | Photos ready | First social impression |
| Week 1 | Post #2: H2 AirPod holder in use (inside open bag; clip on strap) | Pete | Instagram + TikTok | — | AirPod variant introduced |
| Week 1 | Start `demand-log.md` — log all DMs and Etsy views/favs daily | Pete | All | Listings + posts live | Data capture starts |
| Week 2 | Post #3: H1 lifestyle shot (styled flat lay or handbag in use) | Pete | Instagram + TikTok | — | Social proof building |
| Week 2 | Check Etsy listing views: ≥20/listing in 14 days? | Pete | Etsy | 14 days live | TASK-08 VC-02 gate |
| Week 2 | Check DM inquiries: ≥5 genuine purchase inquiries? | Pete | Social | 14 days of posts | TASK-07 VC-01 gate |
| Week 2 | If Etsy views <20: activate €15–30 Etsy Ads experiment | Pete | Etsy | Gate fails | Views supplemented |
| Week 3 | Post #4: H3 Amalfi teaser (location imagery / Positano backdrop) | Pete | Instagram + TikTok | — | H3 variant introduced |
| Week 3 | Start boutique outreach prep for H3 in-destination (TASK-10 pre-work) | Pete | In-destination | — | Outreach list prepared for May |
| Week 4 | Check ≥3 Etsy sales in 28 days (TASK-08 VC-01) and ≥2 DM intent confirms (TASK-07 VC-02) | Pete | All | 28 days live | TASK-09 CHECKPOINT data collected |
| Week 4 | Run `/lp-do-replan` on TASK-10/11 with observed demand data | Pete | — | 28-day data | Downstream tasks re-scored |

### Critical path

1. TASK-02 (supply chain cost) → price floor confirmed → listing prices set
2. TASK-06 (photography + perception test pass) → listings can go live
3. Brand name decision → Etsy shop can be created
4. Day-14 gate check → determines whether Etsy Ads needed or social strategy needs adjustment
5. Day-28 TASK-09 checkpoint → gates TASK-10 (in-destination) and TASK-11 (meta-reflect)

---

## 5) Month 2+ Roadmap (Directional)

- If Etsy + social signal is strong (≥3 sales in 28 days): expand to more product photos, a second Etsy listing variant (H3 online), and continue social with higher frequency
- If in-destination trial (June+) produces ≥5 sales in 4 weeks: maintain and expand to 2 boutiques; consider "Positano exclusive" positioning for H3
- Wholesale/B2B: open only when ≥50 DTC sales confirmed; approach JOOR-registered buyers with H1 (bag charm) — JOOR shows wholesale buyers actively seeking this category
- Own-site / app (cover-me-pretty): build only after ≥50 DTC sales confirm demand; design via `/lp-design-spec`; advance brand dossier to Active first

---

## 6) Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Photography doesn't pass perception test (TASK-06 VC-01 fails) | Critical — gates all channel launch | Reshoot before any listing goes live; do not proceed until ≥3/5 estimate ≥€80 |
| Etsy premium pricing (€95+) suppresses CVR below minimum viable | High — fewer orders than P10 | Etsy Ads €15–30 experiment if views low; at checkpoint, test 10% lower if price-shock DMs dominant |
| New Etsy shop has very low organic discovery | High — without views, no signal | Etsy Ads backup; Instagram/TikTok drives traffic to Etsy listing via bio link |
| Tourist season window too narrow for H3 trial | Medium — if checkpoint clears late | Start boutique outreach in May regardless; if needed, run H3 in-destination with H1 variant (no custom imagery) |
| Brand name not decided before shop launch | Medium — affects Etsy shop coherence | Run `/brand-naming-research` as priority task before TASK-08 begins |
| Supply chain cost exceeds planning range | High — may require price increase above €80 floor | TASK-02 is a hard gate before listings go live; do not list without confirmed margin ≥35% |
