# Business Name Research Prompt — Round 2 (Domain-Gated)

**How to use:** Drop this prompt into a deep research tool (Perplexity Deep Research, Claude, or equivalent). This is a second, distinct research pass building on the round-1 output. Round 1 produced 8 candidates; domain screening eliminated 3 hard blockers. Round 2 must generate fresh candidates, not simply re-rank the survivors.

**Language:** en-GB. **Current date:** 2026-02-21 (Europe/Rome). State dates for any time-sensitive findings (domain status, trade mark filings, competitor availability).

## Role and method

You are a naming strategist and researcher on a second research pass for an established brief. A prior round of research produced 8 shortlisted names. Domain screening has eliminated 3 candidates as hard blockers. Your job is to:

1. Treat the 5 surviving names from round 1 as context anchors — understand what made them work linguistically and strategically, but do not simply repackage them.
2. Generate fresh name candidates that meet all original criteria **plus** the new hard domain constraint below.
3. Re-screen and re-rank surviving round-1 names alongside new candidates, using the same criteria.

Use web research and cite sources for all factual statements, domain checks, and trade mark observations. Separate clearly: (a) what you checked, (b) what you inferred, and (c) what remains unknown without professional legal counsel.

## Hard domain constraint — NEW, takes priority over all other criteria

**The `.com` domain must be freely registerable at standard registration cost (approximately USD 10–15/year).**

- Parked domains, redirecting domains, and domains listed for brokered sale at any premium are **hard blockers** — eliminate immediately.
- Do not propose a name if `.com` is taken, regardless of how strong the name is strategically.
- Check `.com` availability for every name direction you evaluate. Report status clearly: free / taken-active / taken-parked / for-sale-premium.
- This constraint is the result of real-world screening: the top two round-1 recommendations (Nidilo, Telilo) were eliminated for this reason.

## Round-1 results — what happened

### Eliminated (hard domain blockers)

| Name | Domain status | Reason eliminated |
|---|---|---|
| Nidilo | nidilo.com parked — redirects to an unrelated article | Parked domain, hard blocker |
| Telilo | telilo.com for sale ~$1,500 | Premium brokered, hard blocker |
| Nidela | nidela.com for sale ~$1,500 | Premium brokered, hard blocker |

### Survivors from round 1 (context anchors for round 2)

These five names passed domain screening — `.com` appears freely available. They are **not** a final shortlist; they are anchors. Evaluate them alongside fresh candidates and re-rank the full set.

| Name | Round-1 rank | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tessilo | 3 | Textile adjacency — possible descriptive overlap concern |
| Tramilo | 4 | Medium-High territory fit |
| Calafilo | 5 | Medium-High fit |
| Filocalma | 6 | Longer string; pronunciation QA flagged |
| Nuvafilo | 7 | Medium fit — ranked lower in round 1 |

### What worked linguistically in round 1

The round-1 names converged on a pattern: short coined words with Italian-friendly phonetics, soft consonants, and an `-ilo` or `-ela` suffix that gives warmth and distinctiveness. Use this as a generative starting point but actively explore other phonetic patterns too — do not over-index on `-ilo`.

## Business context (unchanged from round 1)

I am launching a direct-to-consumer lifestyle brand selling **soft retention headbands** that keep external cochlear implant (CI) sound processors secure during daily life — school, play, sport, sleep, and everyday activity.

**Critical positioning:** This is a comfort, retention, and aesthetic accessory for existing CI users. It makes no medical efficacy claims and is not a medical device.

**Regulatory nuance:** Under EU MDR, an "accessory for a medical device" is defined as an article intended to be used *together* with a medical device to enable it to be used in accordance with its intended purpose. Flag any name that could be interpreted as a medical-purpose claim or as framing the product as necessary for the implant to work. Focus on comfort, security, and everyday usability language — not treatment or therapy outcomes.

**Primary customer:** Parents and caregivers of young children (approximately 6 months+) with cochlear implants.

**Secondary customers:** Active and sport-oriented CI users of any age; adult daily-comfort users.

**Launch market:** Italy (primary), then broader EU and US.

**Price range:** EUR 12–32 (core tier EUR 18–32).

**Emotional territory:** Reassuring, practical, approachable, inclusive, warm.

**Growth intent:** Naming territory must accommodate expansion from headbands into broader hearing-accessory lifestyle products (pouches, covers, clips, tethers) and possibly into other hearing device communities.

## Naming criteria (unchanged from round 1)

A strong name should:

1. Be pronounceable and memorable in English; comfortable in Italian phonetics
2. Avoid implying medical function
3. Feel warm and human, not device-manufacturer or clinical-brand adjacent
4. Have room to grow beyond headbands
5. Be distinctive within the category
6. Have a freely registerable `.com` domain (hard constraint — see above)

---

## Anti-criteria (hard constraints, unchanged from round 1)

Do not propose names that:

- Use "cochlear" as a component
- Use audiology or disability-identity terms ("hearing loss", "deaf", "impaired")
- Sound like a medical device, pharmaceutical, or clinical brand
- Are acronyms or initialisms
- Imply hiding or disguising the CI processor ("stealth", "invisible", "discreet", "conceal")
- Are too generic to be ownable
- Have obvious negative connotations in Italian, Spanish, French, or German
- Have `.com` taken (any status — active, parked, brokered)

## Research tracks and required outputs

### Track 1: Fresh name generation

Generate at least **20 new name candidates** (distinct from round-1 names). For each, immediately check `.com` availability and eliminate any with taken domains before including in analysis. Report: name / domain status / why included or eliminated.

Explore at least two phonetic patterns beyond `-ilo`:
- Endings: `-ela`, `-ara`, `-ina`, `-ora`, `-ova`, `-ura`, `-ana`, `-etta`, `-ello`, `-ello`, `-ello`
- Structures: two-syllable coined words; three-syllable with soft consonants; compound constructions with Italian-friendly morphemes

Stay in Territory B (lifestyle/everyday normalisation) and Territory E (coined/invented) as the primary generative zones — these were confirmed as the strongest strategic fit in round 1. Include at least 3–5 candidates from Territory A (retention/security language, elevated) as a check.

### Track 2: Re-screen round-1 survivors

For the five surviving round-1 names (Tessilo, Tramilo, Calafilo, Filocalma, Nuvafilo), provide:
- Confirm `.com` availability (with date checked)
- Italian phonetics re-assessment
- Territory-fit re-assessment against the full strategic criteria
- Distinctiveness spectrum placement (generic → descriptive → suggestive → arbitrary → coined)
- Updated rank relative to new round-2 candidates

### Track 3: Italian and EU suitability

For all names that pass domain screening (round-1 survivors + new round-2 candidates):
- Italian phonetics: ease of pronunciation, stress placement, consonant clusters
- Unintended meaning, homophones, or connotations in Italian
- Quick risk scan in Spanish, French, and German
- Whether the name feels approachable to Italian-speaking parents who are not confident English speakers

### Track 4: Trade mark risk flags

For the top 10–15 names that pass domain screening:
- Screen for obvious conflicts in Nice Classes 25 and 10
- Note if Class 35 appears relevant
- State clearly: (a) what you checked, (b) what you inferred, (c) what remains uncertain
- This is a preliminary risk flag, not a legal clearance

### Track 5: Expansion headroom

Identify which names best support expansion from headbands into broader hearing-accessory lifestyle products. Reference Deafmetal as a benchmark for territory-choice affecting long-run brand architecture.

## Deliverables format

Write as a research document in en-GB. Use tables and ranked lists. Required sections:

1. **Domain eligibility pass/fail** — all 20+ new candidates screened, pass/fail stated, eliminated names listed with reason
2. **Re-screened round-1 survivors** — updated assessment of the 5 survivors against all criteria
3. **Combined ranking** — top 8–10 names from the combined pool (survivors + new), ranked by: (a) `.com` confirmed free, (b) strategic differentiation, (c) Italian accessibility, (d) expansion headroom, (e) likely TM ownability
4. **Territory evaluation** — for Territory B and Territory E, which names from the combined pool best represent each
5. **Italian + EU suitability notes** — top 10 names; phonetics, connotations, cross-language risk flags
6. **Trade mark risk flags** — top 10 names; clearly label checked vs inferred vs unknown; domain status with date
7. **Distinctiveness spectrum summary** — for all shortlisted directions, spectrum placement and TM protectability implications
8. **Recommended shortlist** — 5–8 names with confirmed free `.com`, ranked; 2–3 sentence rationale per name
9. **Recommended name (forced choice)** — if forced to pick one name to proceed with today, which and why?
