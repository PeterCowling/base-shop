    "personalBelongingsSecurity": "Each guest is responsible for their personal belongings throughout their stay. Lockers and safe boxes are provided where available; using them is simple but does not shift liability to the hostel, so we recommend keeping your travel-insurance up to date. For everyone’s peace of mind, keep room doors shut and secure the locker provided—items. Items left behind for more than 30 days will be donated, recycled, or disposed of.",
    "identificationSecurityBands": "To help staff quickly recognise registered guests, everyone receives a security wristband at check-in. Please wear it while on hostel premises; our team may also ask to see photo ID. If your band is lost or damaged, let reception know—there is a small replacement fee. Guests who are not wearing a wristband or who decline to show ID may be asked to leave, and refunds may not be possible.",
    "cctvSurveillance": "Shared areas—including the entrance, hallways, terrace, and common rooms—are monitored by CCTV 24 hours a day. Recordings are stored securely, accessed only by authorised staff. The cameras support guest safety but cannot guarantee against loss, theft, or damage, so please stay alert and secure your valuables.",
    "temporaryGuestsPolicy": "Please speak with reception before inviting friends to visit, so we can issue them Temporary Guest status. Once signed in with valid ID, day visitors may enjoy communal spaces between 10:30 and 20:00. For everyone’s privacy, guest rooms remain for registered overnight guests only. The hostel may refuse or withdraw Temporary Guest status at its discretion.",
    "unregisteredPersonsPolicy": "Italian law requires that every overnight guest be registered. If an unregistered person is found staying in a room, the registered guest(s) will be charged the standard room rate for that person plus an administrative fee equal to twice that amount. The additional guest must complete check-in immediately or depart; if they decline, the hostel is obliged to contact the local authorities. Not declaring an overnight guest may also result in the booking being recorded as a No-Show."
