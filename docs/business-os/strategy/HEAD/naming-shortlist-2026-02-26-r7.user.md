## Round observations

**Max score reached 24 — a new round high.** R7 introduced the -andra and -ella suffix family more systematically across Patterns A and C. The -andra ending (drawn from the proper noun register) consistently pushed D scores to 5 by creating coinages with near-zero prior-art exposure. The -tella and -ella Pattern C fragment blends also performed strongly, producing clean short-wordmark names (8–9 letters) with excellent Italian phonetics.

**T1 (Hair Secure) depth is excellent.** Twenty-six AVAILABLE names in this territory, with 10 scoring 24 or 23. The dur- and kept- morpheme families continue to outperform because the retention/endurance semantic is instantly legible to the caregiver ICP. Durmella and Keptella are the standout new coinages — neither appeared in prior rounds.

**T2 (Organised Safe) is the strongest territory by volume.** Thirty AVAILABLE names, six at score 24. Stivandra and Tracandra are the top picks — the -andra suffix gives both a distinctiveness score of 5 while the stiv- and trac- roots ground them immediately in the EDC/kit register.

**T3 (Part of You) produced the two most memorable names.** Abituandra and Wornandra both score 24 and both pass the scroll test immediately — an Italian caregiver parent would stop at either and read "habitual, always on them" without needing to know Italian etymology. Tuovella (score 24 in table; AVAILABLE) was also checked — the shortlist uses Tuovandra as the stronger wordmark.

**T4 (Worn Out Loud) is crowded at 24.** Five names at 24: Brillandra, Brilltella, Mostrandra, Sfogandra, Spictella. All five are domain-free. The shortlist presents four. Brilltella was dropped to prevent -tella duplication with Fondtella and Spictella in the visible set.

**T5 (Easy Hair System) has the shallowest available pool.** Only 2 names at score 24 (Facilella, Sempella), both chosen. Autonanda at 23 completes the T5 trio. The spa/wellness test eliminated several otherwise viable Italian ease-vocabulary words (the real-word Pattern E candidates in T5 — spontanea, rapida, veloce — were all TAKEN).

**Note on duplicates:** Seven names appeared in two separate rows of the candidate table (Pattern A and Pattern C / B variants): Wornandra, Wornella, Ordinanda, Outanda, Outella, Stivanda, Tuovella. For each, the first appearance (lowest row number) was used in scoring. Domains were checked once each; both occurrences returned the same RDAP result (AVAILABLE).
