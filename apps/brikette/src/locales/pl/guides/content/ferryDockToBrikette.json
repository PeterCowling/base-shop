  "intro": [
    "Arriving by ferry with luggage? Combine the Interno Positano bus with Positano's porters to reach Hostel Brikette without hauling bags up steep staircases. This route takes 20-45 minutes depending on porter and bus timing, costs €2-€6 per person plus optional porter fees, and eliminates most of Positano's infamous stair-climbing.",
    "Updated for the 2026 season, this guide covers exact costs, bus schedules, porter pricing, and the step-by-step route our staff recommend to hundreds of arriving guests. Whether you're traveling solo with a backpack or as a group with multiple suitcases, you'll find practical advice for a smooth arrival."

      "title": "What to expect at Positano ferry dock",
      "body": [
        "Positano's ferry dock (officially Positano Spiaggia) sits at beach level at the base of the town. When you disembark, you'll walk down a short gangway onto the main beach promenade. The entire waterfront area is compact — you can see the beach, the ticket kiosks, and the start of the uphill path all within 100 meters.",
        "Porter services meet every ferry arrival. You'll spot them immediately — they wear bright vests and wait with wheeled carts near the gangway. From the dock, you have three main options: hire porters to transport your bags separately (recommended for heavy luggage), take the Interno Positano bus partway up (fastest and easiest), or walk the entire route (only practical with light daypack).",
        "The beach area has restrooms (€1), a few cafés, and ticket kiosks where you can buy Interno bus tickets. Most ferries arrive between 09:00-19:00 in summer season (April-October), with the busiest periods around 11:00-14:00. If your ferry is running late, check the %LINK:ferrySchedules|current ferry schedules% for updated arrival times.",
        "Ferry services to Positano run from multiple ports along the Amalfi Coast. If you're arriving from Salerno, Naples, or Sorrento, ferries typically dock at Positano Spiaggia between late morning and early evening. The dock handles both hydrofoils (aliscafi) and slower traditional ferries (traghetti). Hydrofoils are faster but more expensive, while traditional ferries offer outdoor seating and better views. Both arrive at the same dock and follow the same disembarkation process.",
        "Weather can affect ferry schedules significantly. During rough seas or high winds (common in autumn and winter), ferries may be delayed, rerouted to alternative ports, or cancelled entirely. If you're traveling during shoulder season (March-April or September-November), always have a backup plan. The %LINK:amalfiPositanoBus|SITA bus from Amalfi% or other coastal towns can serve as an alternative if your ferry is cancelled, though you'll arrive at Chiesa Nuova instead of the beach level."

      "body": [
        "Positano's official porter service charges €15-€20 per bag depending on size and weight. A standard backpack or suitcase (up to 20kg) costs €15, while oversized bags or multiple items cost €18-€20. Payment is cash only — have euros ready at the dock.",
        "Porters load your bags onto wheeled carts and deliver them directly to Hostel Brikette's entrance within 30-45 minutes. You hand over your luggage, tell them 'Hostel Brikette' (they know it), pay the fee, and keep your valuables with you. The porters take a different route using service paths and shortcuts, so you won't see your bags until you reach the hostel — this is normal.",
        "From our experience hosting hundreds of ferry arrivals: porters are reliable and bags always arrive safely, but we recommend keeping medications, electronics, and travel documents in your daypack. If you're traveling as a couple or group, consider using porters for heavy bags while keeping one small bag each for the journey.

        "**Bus only (no porters):** 25-35 minutes carrying your own bags, €2-€6 per person. You'll manage stairs at the port (short flight), walk with luggage to Piazza dei Mulini (5 minutes uphill), and carry bags on/off the bus. Suitable for travelers with one small backpack or light luggage.",

Call or WhatsApp +39 379 125 6222 to book — say 'Hostel Brikette' and they know the location. Taxis can't drive all the way to the hostel entrance (no vehicle access), but they'll drop you at the closest road point, about 50 meters from our stairs. If you have mobility concerns, discuss this with the taxi driver beforehand.",
        "**Late-night arrivals (after 23:00):** The Interno bus runs until approximately midnight, but check the exact schedule for your arrival date. If your ferry arrives after the last bus, your options are taxi (€25-€35) or walking without luggage if you've sent bags ahead. Don't attempt the full walk with heavy bags in darkness — the route has uneven stairs and poor lighting in sections. Our reception team can stay late to meet you if you message ahead with your arrival time.",
        "**If Interno buses are full or delayed:** During peak season (July-August), the Interno bus can fill up quickly, especially around ferry arrival times. If you miss one bus, another arrives within 30 minutes. Alternatively, walk to Piazza dei Mulini and catch the bus there (it's usually less crowded at that stop), or use a taxi as backup. Some guests prefer to wait for the second or third bus rather than cramming into an overcrowded vehicle with luggage — this is perfectly fine and the extra 30 minutes won't significantly impact your arrival."

        "**Best arrival strategy according to our staff:** Hand your main luggage to porters at the dock (most guests use this — it's worth the €15-20 per bag), keep a small daypack with essentials, buy your Interno bus ticket during the walk to Piazza dei Mulini, and take the bus to Chiesa Nuova. This way you arrive relaxed, bags-free, and ready to enjoy Positano.",
        "**When porters save the most effort:** If you have bags over 15kg, multiple suitcases, or traveling in summer heat, porters are essential. We've seen too many guests arrive exhausted from carrying bags uphill — the €15-20 cost is minor compared to starting your Positano stay stressed and sweaty.",
        "**Coordinate porter delivery timing:** If you're arriving before our check-in time (15:00), tell the porters when you expect to arrive at the hostel so they can time the delivery. Bags usually arrive 30-45 minutes after you hand them over, which gives you time to take the bus and reach the hostel entrance.",
        "**Keep bus change ready:** Interno bus tickets cost €2-€6 depending on season and exact route. Ticket vendors at tabacchi accept cash only (small bills preferred — don't expect them to break a €50 note). Have a few €5 or €10 notes ready at the dock."
