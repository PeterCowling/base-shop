# Replan Module: Business Artifact Track

Use for `Execution-Track: business-artifact`.

## Goal

Raise delivery confidence using explicit VC checks, fail-first evidence status, and operational readiness.

## Required Actions

1. Hypothesis/signal freshness
- Check whether prior signals are current and relevant.
- Flag stale assumptions and add precursor tasks where needed.

2. Channel/approval/measurement readiness
- Verify channel constraints and approval path still hold.
- Verify measurement ownership/cadence is actionable.

3. Approach and impact
- Compare alternatives when needed.
- Update impact notes for market/policy/supplier drift.

## Fail-First Rule

Apply shared policy:
- `../../_shared/fail-first-biz.md`

If Red/Green/Refactor evidence is missing and replan cannot gather it without execution, add precursor tasks and keep confidence capped.
