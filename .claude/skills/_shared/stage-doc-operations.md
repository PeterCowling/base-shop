# Stage Doc Operations — SPLIT

This file has been split into three focused files. Update any references to point to the relevant replacement:

| Content | New file |
|---|---|
| Stage types registry, frontmatter schema, creation procedures, evidence types, idempotency | `./stage-doc-core.md` |
| Full stage doc templates (fact-find, plan, build, reflect) | `./stage-doc-templates.md` |
| Skill integration notes, lane transitions, related resources | `./stage-doc-integration.md` |

**Skills using BOS integration:** use `./stage-doc-core.md` — it contains all runtime-required content.
