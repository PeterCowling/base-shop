This guide is about the stop itself: what it’s called on timetables (often \\\\\"Positano (Chiesa Nuova)\\\\\"), which side to queue for eastbound vs westbound buses, where to buy and validate tickets (single rides are usually €2.50–€4 depending on destination), what to expect in summer crowds, and—quickly—the easiest 2–4 minute walk from the hostel to the stop.",

        "The **Chiesa Nuova / Bar Internazionale** stop is the closest SITA bus stop to Hostel Brikette and usually the easiest way to get on a bus without tackling Positano’s long staircases. If you’re exploring the coast for the day, heading to a train connection in Sorrento, or starting a longer travel day via Salerno, this is the practical “base stop” for the hostel.",
        "It’s also one of the easiest stops to use correctly because the queue locations are simple: **eastbound to Amalfi/Salerno** is on the sea‑view side of the road (opposite Bar Internazionale), and **westbound to Sorrento/Naples** is on the mountain side (outside Bar Internazionale).",
        "From Hostel Brikette, it’s a short 120 metre (400 foot), 2–4 minute walk along Viale Pasitea. The sidewalk is wide enough for luggage and is well-lit at night.",

The ride takes about 40 minutes to Amalfi and 50 minutes to Sorrento, but can take longer during busy summer days when traffic is heavy.",

The first bus going west to Sorrento usually leaves around 6:45–7:15am. Check the current times at Bar Internazionale or ask at hostel reception because the schedule changes with the seasons. In summer there are more buses than in winter.",

Always check the exact times at reception or look at the SITA schedule posted at the stop. Try to catch the second-to-last bus if you are traveling at night so you do not miss the last one and get stuck.",

A 24-hour Costiera pass costs €8.00 and lets you take as many buses as you want between Sorrento and Salerno. The day pass is a good deal if you plan to take more than three trips in one day.",
        "**Validation:** Show your ticket to the driver when you get on the bus. The driver will stamp or partially tear it to mark it as used. On newer buses, you can also scan your ticket at the machine just inside the door. Keep your validated ticket for the whole ride—ticket checkers often get on the bus and check tickets. If you do not have a validated ticket, you will get a fine right away that costs much more than the ticket.",
        "**Buy ahead:** If you are catching the first bus in the morning (before 7:30am), buy your ticket the night before because the tabacchi may not be open yet. Come to hostel reception if you need to check out early. The bar also sells tickets and opens earlier than the tabacchi, usually by 6:30am.",

Get to the stop at least 10–15 minutes before your bus to get a good spot near the front of the line. If the bus is full, it may not stop at all and you will have to wait for the next one.",
        "**Queue rules:** Make a clear line near the bus shelter on the right side of the road. Do not push or crowd—Italians usually respect the line order. When the bus comes, wait for people to get off before you get on. The driver may close the door if people try to push ahead.",
        "**Luggage:** There is not much room for luggage on SITA buses—usually just a small space at the back or under the seats. If you have big backpacks or suitcases, try to board early to get a luggage spot. Think about using a %LINK:porterServices|porter service% to carry your luggage to your next place if you have heavy bags. Most buses only have room for 4-5 large bags in the back compartment.",
        "**Standing room:** On full summer buses, you may need to stand for part or all of the ride. The coastal road has many turns and sharp corners, so hold on tight to the bars above your head or the seat backs. The driver may brake hard if a car stops suddenly ahead."

See %LINK:salernoPositano|Salerno to Positano% for the reverse journey and %LINK:salernoGatewayGuide|Salerno gateway guide% for train connections.",

See our %LINK:ferrySchedules|ferry schedules guide% for timetables and our %LINK:briketteToFerryDock|walking route to the dock%.",

        "**Scooter rental:** Experienced riders can rent a scooter in Positano and drive the coastal road themselves. See our %LINK:scooterRentalPositano|scooter rental guide% for rental shops, pricing, and safety tips.

However, pay attention to your footing—the sidewalk narrows in a couple of spots where it meets parked scooters or outdoor cafe seating. If you're catching a late bus, leave a few extra minutes to navigate carefully in reduced visibility.",
        "**Peak travel times to avoid:** If you have flexibility in your schedule, avoid catching buses during the busiest periods: 9:00–11:00am (day-trippers arriving), 4:00–6:00pm (day-trippers departing). Buses during these windows often fill completely at earlier stops, leaving passengers stranded at the Chiesa Nuova / Bar Internazionale stop. Instead, aim for early morning departures (7:00–8:30am) or mid-afternoon (1:00–3:00pm) when you're more likely to get a seat.",
        "**Weather considerations:** The walk is exposed to the elements—there's no covered section between the hostel and the bus shelter. In heavy rain, you'll get wet during the 2-minute walk. Bring an umbrella or rain jacket if the forecast looks uncertain. In summer heat, the sidewalk offers no shade; wear sunscreen and bring water if you're arriving at the stop early to queue. Winter can bring strong winds along this exposed section of Viale Pasitea—secure any loose items in your bag.",
        "**Leaving bags at reception:** If you're checking out but need to explore Positano for a few hours before your bus, ask at reception about leaving your luggage. This lets you walk to the stop later without bags and simply collect them on your way to catch the bus. This is especially useful if you want to visit the beach or have lunch in town before departing."
