## Research Prompt

---

### 1. Role and Method

You are a product-type landscape researcher. Your task is to map the range of viable product-type approaches to a specific customer problem. The goal is not to recommend a product, but to enumerate distinct options with honest feasibility signals. Each option should be treated independently.

**Do NOT score demand, estimate market size, or assess whether customers want this. Feasibility flags only at this stage.** That assessment happens in a later stage.

---

### 2. Problem Context

The following is the problem statement for the business. Quote it faithfully in your reasoning.

**Core Problem:**

Fashion-conscious women who already own premium handbags (designer or "premium high-street") want artisan-quality, aesthetically distinctive bag accessories (bag charms, AirPod holders, small pouches / mini-SLGs) that feel premium-but-accessible (target: €80–€150) and come with a credible brand/story.

In most markets they face a forced choice:

- Mass-market options (€5–€35) that look disposable, generic, or "cheap" — low craftsmanship, low story value, or
- Luxury-house options (€300–€1,500+) that are priced and distributed as luxury signalling goods, often boutique-gated, relationship-gated, and in limited supply.

Separately, luxury-destination visitors (e.g., Amalfi Coast) who want a place-specific, wearable premium souvenir face the same binary: mass-produced trinkets or unbranded leather goods with weak provenance and no recognisable "story container."

**Affected User Groups:**

*Group 1 — The handbag personaliser (primary):* Women ~27–42, fashion-aware, who own one or more bags at the LV/Gucci entry tier and above (~€600–€1,500 bag ownership). Motivations: personal expression ("making a widely-owned style feel unmistakably mine"), craft appreciation (wanting something that looks made with real skill, not printed in China), playful self-expression against a serious/investment bag, quality that "reads real" in hand and in photos.

*Group 2 — The luxury-destination tourist (seasonal, secondary):* International visitors to the Amalfi Coast with high daily spend ($391–$1,098/person/day) and a short purchase window (1–3 days). Motivations: a souvenir that is wearable and giftable (not decorative clutter), place prestige + artisan credibility, low time for research (needs fast trust signals in-store).

*Group 3 — Premium gift buyer (tertiary):* Gift purchasers in the €80–€150 bracket who want "special + story-worthy" without the complexity of luxury-house access. A gift that looks considered and expensive relative to price; packaging and story does a lot of work.

**Additional operator context:** The operator has an existing physical product — a high-quality Birkin-style mini handbag (structured body, gold hardware, leather-look exterior, multi-colour options). The question is which product-type approach to pursue with this physical asset. The operator is based in Positano, Italy, and has direct access to the Amalfi Coast tourist market through a hostel.

---

### 3. Solution Type Landscape

Enumerate 5–10 distinct product-type approaches that use the operator's existing Birkin-style mini handbag product to address the stated problem. Options should differ in product category or primary use case — not merely in feature or colour. Treat each independently.

Candidate angles to investigate (expand or add others as evidence warrants):

1. **Bag charm / handbag accessory** — mini bag worn as a decorative attachment on a larger handbag strap via gold clasp
2. **AirPod holder / small-items case** — mini bag repositioned as a functional tech accessory, with the interior sized to hold AirPods Pro; attaches to a handbag
3. **Destination souvenir** — mini bag with Amalfi Coast / Positano location branding, sold in-destination at the hostel, local boutiques, or hotel gift shops
4. **Dog accessories holder** — mini bag as a luxury dog poop bag holder or leash attachment accessory
5. **Children's first bag** — mini bag repositioned as a premium gift item for girls age 6–10
6. **Premium gift set** — mini bag as the hero item in a curated premium travel/fashion gift set with secondary items
7. **Keyring / everyday carry accessory** — mini bag as a premium keychain-scale item for daily carry

---

### 4. Per-Option Feasibility Criteria

For each option, assess the following four criteria. Do not score demand or assess customer desire — feasibility flags only.

1. **Launch timeline** — Can this be launched by a one-person operator within 6 months with less than €2,000 capital? What are the blockers?
2. **Distribution path** — Are there proven, accessible channels for this product type (Etsy, Instagram/TikTok organic, boutique consignment, in-destination retail)? Does this operator's Positano location create a specific advantage for any option?
3. **Technical, operational, or capital constraints** — What would prevent or delay launch? Include product-development requirements (e.g., interior sizing modification, hardware changes), supply chain unknowns, and bandwidth constraints for a solo operator.
4. **Adjacent successful businesses** — Is there evidence of other small makers or brands succeeding in this space at the €80–€150 price point? Name examples if they exist.

---

### 5. Regulatory and Compliance Flags

**Cross-cutting first:** Identify any regulatory or compliance themes that apply to multiple options. State these once in a "Cross-cutting regulatory flags" section — do not repeat them per option.

Then, for each option, note only requirements that are specific to that option or that meaningfully deviate from the cross-cutting baseline. Examples of option-specific flags:
- CE marking under the Toy Safety Directive — only if a children's product
- Food safety certification — only if a consumable is included
- Electronics compliance — only if the product integrates electronics

Themes that apply to most adult fashion accessory options for EU/UK sale — state once, not per option:
- EU General Product Safety Regulation 2023/988
- REACH chemical restrictions (chromium VI for leather in skin contact; nickel for metal hardware)
- EU product and textile labelling requirements for leather/leather-look goods
- Import/customs considerations for China-sourced product into the EU (EORI, VAT, IOSS)
- IP/trade dress risk from the "Birkin-style" base design — this is a base-asset constraint, not option-specific

Flag "unknown" rather than omitting. Do not research this exhaustively — a flag is sufficient.

---

### 6. Manufacturing and Supply Chain Flags

**Cross-cutting first:** Identify supply chain patterns that apply to most or all physical product options. State these once. Standard MOQ ranges, lead time ranges, key supplier geographies, and white-label availability are broadly similar across bag accessories and small leather goods — do not repeat them per option.

Cross-cutting baseline to establish once:
- Typical MOQ range for mini structured bags / SLGs (~15–20cm)
- Lead times (sampling vs. bulk; peak season variability)
- Key supplier geographies (China, Turkey, Italy, Vietnam, India)
- White-label / existing-stock availability
- EU small parcel import duty (if applicable)

Then, for each option, note only supply chain constraints that are specific to that product type — for example:
- Custom interior fitting requirements (tech-safe padding, AirPod cradle)
- Location-specific graphics applied by supplier
- Specialist materials (waterproof lining, wipeable interior)
- Compliance testing costs that affect COGS

### 7. Deliverables Format

Return results in two parts:

**Part A — Cross-cutting flags** (state once, not repeated per option):
1. **Cross-cutting regulatory framework** — requirements applying to all or most options (EU GPSR, REACH, IP/trade dress base-asset risk, labelling)
2. **Cross-cutting supply chain patterns** — baseline MOQ, lead times, geographies, white-label availability applicable across options

**Part B — Per-option entries** (one per option):
1. **Option name**
2. **Brief description** (2–3 sentences — what it is and who it is for)
3. **Feasibility signals** — bulleted, covering all four criteria in Section 4
4. **Regulatory flags** — option-specific requirements only; cross-cutting items covered in Part A need not be repeated
5. **Supply chain flags** — option-specific constraints only; standard baseline patterns covered in Part A need not be repeated

No comparison rankings between options. No recommendation. No verdict on which to pursue. No demand or market size estimates.
