# Startup Loop Contract Migration Window (Canonical)
#
# This file is canonical for human review and for lint/tooling.
# Runtime MUST NOT read this file from the filesystem.
# Runtime uses a build-time embedded module: apps/business-os/src/lib/contract-migration.generated.ts
#
# Semantics:
# - Cutoffs are inclusive through 23:59:59Z on the given date.
# - If config is missing/invalid at runtime, legacy behavior must fail-closed
#   (aliases + dual-read disabled) while canonical behavior continues.
