## 1. Executive Summary
Dry-run completed with full coverage and no persistence writes. Primary cross-business constraint remains measurement blindness: BRIK lacks live traffic/conversion telemetry, PIPE has no validated fulfillment signal loop, PLAT lacks baseline reliability timing, and BOS lacks process ROI instrumentation.

## 2. Businesses Analyzed
- BRIK (L2): analytics visibility gap is still critical; GA/Search Console not configured (`docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/plan.user.md:22`, `docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/plan.user.md:33`).
- PIPE (L1): no validated order loop and no fulfillment metrics yet (`docs/business-os/strategy/PIPE/plan.user.md:18`, `docs/business-os/strategy/PIPE/plan.user.md:70`).
- PLAT (L3+ infra): build/test reliability lacks measured baseline (`docs/business-os/strategy/PLAT/plan.user.md:18`, `docs/business-os/strategy/PLAT/plan.user.md:64`).
- BOS (coordination): cabinet effectiveness metric pipeline remains uninstrumented (`docs/business-os/strategy/BOS/plan.user.md:72`, `docs/business-os/strategy/BOS/plan.user.md:78`).

## 3. Who Said What (F1)
| Idea | Business | Originator Sub-Expert | Lens | Confidence Tier | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Measurement Baseline Sprint (GA + GSC + KPI dashboard) | BRIK | Drucker coordinator | drucker-porter | presentable | promote |
| Build Reliability Baseline and Failure Taxonomy | PLAT | Code Review Cabinet | code-review | presentable | promote |
| Cabinet Outcome Scoreboard and Weekly Review Cadence | BOS | vantharp | musk | presentable | promote |
| Fulfillment Signal Loop (manual simulation + margin tracker) | PIPE | finder | sourcing | presentable | promote |
| Demand validation before catalog expansion | PIPE | mover | sourcing | decision-gap | hold |
| Guide measurement taxonomy unification | BRIK | hopkins | marketing | decision-gap | hold |

## 4. Reaffirmations/Addenda
- Reaffirmed existing BRIK reception dashboard stream (`docs/business-os/cards/BRIK-ENG-0018.user.md`) as a dependency-aware addendum.
- Reaffirmed existing PLAT measurement-first sequencing before additional platform expansion.

## 5. Generation Phase
Generation cadence respected:
- Divergence pass: 12 raw candidates across participating experts.
- Deepening pass: top 8 candidates selected (hard cap <=10 per business).
- No divergence overflow (>1 candidate per sub-expert) observed.

## 6. Depth Gate
- Pass rate: 8/8 deepened candidates met depth fields (`Evidence-Pointers`, `Falsification-Test`, `First-Signal`).
- DGP reroutes: 2 candidates moved to decision-gap queue where falsification data is still incomplete.

## 7. Confidence Gate
- Presentable: 6
- Decision-gap: 2
- Hunches: 0

## 8. Assumption Challenge (F3)
Assumptions-Source was `none` for this run, so no accept/condition/reject verdict table was required.

## 9. Clustering
- 6 clusters formed; no cross-business merges.
- Rivalries recorded for telemetry-first vs feature-first sequencing in BRIK and PIPE.

## 10. Tool-Gap Register (F2)
| Gap-Type | Missing tool/data gap | Impacted business | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| telemetry | GA + Search Console baseline and conversion instrumentation gap | BRIK | `docs/business-os/strategy/BRIK/plan.user.md:22` |
| experimentation | order-loop measurement sheet and first-sale tracker gap | PIPE | `docs/business-os/strategy/PIPE/plan.user.md:64` |
| reliability | local/CI baseline timing and failure taxonomy gap | PLAT | `docs/business-os/strategy/PLAT/plan.user.md:64` |
| governance | sweep-to-delivery conversion and cycle-time dashboard gap | BOS | `docs/business-os/strategy/BOS/plan.user.md:72` |

## 11. Contrarian Gate
- PASS: 4
- UNRESOLVED: 2
- FAIL: 0

UNRESOLVED items were held due to missing fast falsification evidence rather than forced promotion.

## 12. Munger/Buffett Filter
- Promote: 4
- Hold: 2
- Kill: 0

## 13. Kill/Hold Rationale (F4)
| Idea | Verdict | Reason code | Reason | Restart condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PIPE demand validation before catalog expansion | hold | HOLD-DATA-01 | decision still blocked by absent demand evidence and conversion signal | restart when one complete manual purchase loop and margin telemetry are recorded |
| BRIK guide measurement taxonomy unification | hold | HOLD-DATA-02 | taxonomy work should follow baseline GA/GSC activation to avoid speculative model design | restart when 2 weeks of baseline traffic + conversion data are available |

No kill verdicts this run.

## 14. Drucker/Porter Priority
- P1: 2
- P2: 2
- P3: 0
- P4: 1
- P5: 1

## 15. Economics Gate (F5)
- pass: 4
- blocked: 2

Economics required fields for promoted/card-eligible ideas:
- upside: improved decision velocity and reduced strategic blind spots.
- downside: bounded implementation overhead for instrumentation/setup.
- reversibility: high (instrumentation can be adjusted/rolled back without core product lock-in).
- cost-of-delay: high for BRIK/PIPE due to ongoing execution without feedback loops.
- time-to-signal: 7-14 days for first useful baseline metrics.

Blocked ideas remained held where economics completeness depended on unresolved telemetry/data gaps.

## 16. Cards Created / Preview
Dry-run preview only; no API writes.

| Business | Would-Create Card Title | Priority | Lane | Owner | Why now |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BRIK | BRIK Measurement Baseline Sprint (GA + Search Console + KPI dashboard) | P1 | Inbox | Pete | unlocks growth and conversion decisions |
| PLAT | PLAT Build Reliability Baseline (CI/local timing + failure taxonomy) | P1 | Inbox | Pete | establishes execution reliability baseline |
| BOS | Cabinet Outcome Scoreboard (sweep->card->done conversion + cycle time) | P2 | Inbox | Pete | makes coordination ROI measurable |
| PIPE | PIPE Fulfillment Signal Loop (manual order simulation + margin telemetry sheet) | P2 | Inbox | Pete | establishes first real commercialization signal |

## 17. Fact-Find Seeding / Preview
Dry-run preview only; no stage-doc writes.

| Rank | Would-Seed Fact-Find For | Priority | Template | Selection basis |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | BRIK Measurement Baseline Sprint | P1 | standard | highest strategic unblocker and strongest evidence density |
| 2 | PLAT Build Reliability Baseline | P1 | standard | cross-cutting leverage for delivery reliability |
| 3 | BOS Cabinet Outcome Scoreboard | P2 | standard | required to measure process effectiveness |

## 18. Existing Card Addenda
- Existing priorities were handled as reaffirmation notes only; no top-K mixing with pre-existing cards.

## 19. Technical Cabinet
Status: triggered.

| Technical idea | applies_to | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Build reliability baseline instrumentation | ["PLAT"] | merged into promoted PLAT card |
| Cabinet process telemetry instrumentation | ["BOS"] | merged into promoted BOS card |
| Cross-sweep metrics normalization | ["cross-cutting"] | kept as supporting recommendation |

## 20. DGPs Created
| Business | DGP Title | Gap-Type | VOI-Score | Decision blocked |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| PIPE | PIPE demand-signal before catalog expansion | data | 0.90 | whether to sequence catalog infrastructure now |
| BRIK | Guide quality measurement taxonomy unification | data | 0.80 | whether to optimize for traffic vs conversion first |

## 21. DGP Resurfacing
No eligible pre-existing DGPs surfaced as ready-now/watch during this run.

## 22. Persistence Accounting

## 23. Reconciliation Checklist
Not required: run was dry-run with zero persistence writes and no stale index condition.

Context discipline mode: Full.
Coverage ratio remained 100% with no summary-block fallback and no rerun trigger.

## 25. Signal Quality
- presentable-rate: 75%

Interpretation: healthy quality distribution with deliberate hold behavior for unresolved data-dependent ideas.

- held delta vs prior sweep artifact: +0
- killed delta vs prior sweep artifact: +0
- reaffirmation delta: +1

## Completion Message
Cabinet sweep dry-run complete. Report: `docs/business-os/sweeps/2026-02-10-sweep.user.md`. Persistence mode: dry-run (no ideas/cards/stage-doc writes). 6 presentable ideas, 4 would-create cards, 3 would-seed fact-find docs.
