# PWRB Naming Generation Spec — Round 1

---

## §1. What this brand is

**The product:** Shared powerbank rental station network. A tourist picks up a portable powerbank unit (8,000–10,000mAh, with built-in cables) at a participating café, hotel, or shop; carries it all day while hiking, taking ferries, and navigating; and returns it to any participating venue before or after dinner. Rental price: €3–6/day. Deposit: €25 pre-authorisation hold (not a charge, released on return). The tourist never owns the powerbank. The "return anywhere" model — not tethered to one venue — is the core product distinction.

**The gap being filled:** No shared powerbank rental network exists on the Amalfi Coast as of 2026. The gap is between "free venue socket charging" (requires sitting at a table, does not travel) and "buy a cheap €15–20 powerbank at a tobacconist" (wasteful, creates a carry-back problem for air travellers). PWRB fits the €3–6 per-day slot that delivers genuine mobility — tourist carries the power with them, not back to the café.

**Primary buyer:** International tourist from the US, UK, Germany, France, or Scandinavia. Typically 28–55 years old, on a 1–5 night Amalfi Coast stay as part of a wider Italy itinerary. High daily spend ($391–$1,098). High smartphone dependency for Google Maps navigation, photography, mobile ticketing (ferries, SITA buses). Flies in — carry-back of a new powerbank is a nuisance. Discovery most likely at hotel check-in, café counter, or at the moment battery drops below 30% mid-exploration.

**Secondary buyer:** Italian domestic tourist on a 1–3 day Sorrento or Vico Equense break, arriving by car. Same navigational dependency. Slightly more price-aware; knows the area but still relies on smartphone for photos and WhatsApp coordination with family. Less likely to buy, more likely to ask the hotel desk.

**Brand personality (inferred — no dossier yet):** The brand should feel light, mobile, and effortlessly Italian-coastal — not a gadget rental shop, not a telecom brand, not a utility. Warm, not corporate. Confident, not flashy. It works for a couple at a cliffside restaurant table as much as for a group navigating the Sentiero degli Dei.

**What the brand must NOT sound like:**
- Generic consumer electronics: "PowerNet", "ChargeCo", "BatteryBank", "ChargePoint"
- Silicon Valley tech startup: "-ify", "-ly", "-io" suffixes that scream app brand
- Confusable with major powerbank brands: Anker, Mophie, Belkin, JuiceBar (UK brand in this category)
- Clinical or medical framing — "Charge" as a standalone word has ambulance connotations in some European languages
- So geographically specific (e.g. "Amalfi" in the name) that it feels locked to one town and blocks multi-destination expansion

**Growth intent:** The model is designed for tourism corridors where return-anywhere network density is achievable. After the Amalfi Coast pilot, the brand could expand to other Italian tourist destinations (Cinque Terre, Lake Como, Puglia towns) and potentially Southern European beach/heritage destinations. The name must feel like a brand, not a local utility.

## §2. Who the name is being evaluated for (ICP resonance anchor)

**Primary test:** Would an international tourist — a 38-year-old American or British traveller at 33% battery at 9:30am in a Positano café, about to start the walk to Nocelle — immediately understand that this brand offers a powerbank they can take with them all day and return later, and decide within 20 seconds that €5 is completely reasonable?

**Secondary test:** Would an Italian weekender at a Sorrento hotel's reception desk — slightly sceptical about being charged for something they feel they should have planned — feel that this is a trustworthy, modern service rather than a tourist-trap rental with catches?

## §3. Scoring rubric

#### D — Distinctiveness (1–5)
- **5:** Fully invented, no obvious phonetic cousin in the competitive set, strong TM ownability signal
- **4:** Coined or obscure real word, low competitor confusion risk
- **3:** Somewhat unique but shares phonetic territory with known brands or common words in the category
- **2:** Sounds like it could be many things; generic feel; weak TM position likely
- **1:** Directly confused with a competitor, a dominant brand in the category, or a known generic term

#### W — Wordmark quality (1–5)
- **5:** 7–12 letters, strong visual rhythm, no awkward letter pairs, works in caps and mixed case, memorable as a handle
- **4:** Solid wordmark with minor reservations
- **3:** Functional but unremarkable; forgettable visually
- **2:** Too long (>13 letters), hard to abbreviate, or visually cluttered
- **1:** Does not work as a wordmark

#### P — Phonetic quality (1–5)
- **5:** Flows naturally in both launch languages (Italian + English), soft open vowels, no consonant clusters, 3–4 syllables, immediately memorable; no embarrassing meaning in French, German, or Scandinavian
- **4:** Mostly smooth; minor awkwardness in one language
- **3:** Pronounceable but no standout quality; forgettable aurally
- **2:** Awkward in one language; requires instruction
- **1:** Genuinely difficult or unpleasant to say in either language

#### E — Expansion headroom (1–5)
- **5:** Non-product-specific; works for any product in the brand's growth category
- **4:** Strong umbrella potential with minor category pull toward initial product
- **3:** Works broadly but feels slightly product-specific
- **2:** Only works for the initial product; would feel wrong on adjacent SKUs
- **1:** Trapped to a specific product form, function, or place

#### I — ICP resonance (1–5)
- **5:** Immediately feels like a brand the primary buyer (an international tourist in a hurry, battery at 30%) would trust in 5 seconds at a café counter — warm, Mediterranean, light, mobile; evokes movement and freedom rather than tech or utility; works equally well on a station placard and an Instagram handle
- **4:** Appealing and on-tone; feels right for a tourism-context service rental brand; the primary buyer would not hesitate
- **3:** Neutral; neither repels nor attracts the primary buyer specifically; could be any light-touch service brand
- **2:** Too technical, too corporate, or too place-specific to connect — sounds like a telecom or a utility rather than a day-rental that travels with you
- **1:** Actively wrong for the ICP — would cause hesitation, confusion, or a "what is this?" response at the counter

#### Composite score
Sum D + W + P + E + I. Maximum 25. Minimum 5.
Names with composite ≥ 18 are high-priority for RDAP batch check. Names 14–17 secondary. Names ≤ 13 low-priority but still included.

## §4. Generation patterns and morpheme pools

### 4.1 Universal generation patterns (copy verbatim — do not rewrite)

Five patterns. Every generated name must use one. State the pattern in the output table.

**Target distribution across 250 names:**
- Pattern A: 80 names
- Pattern B: 50 names
- Pattern C: 50 names
- Pattern D: 40 names
- Pattern E: 30 names

**Root diversity rule:** No more than 4 names may share the same opening root (first 3 letters).

**Suffix diversity rule:** No more than 6 names may use the same suffix ending.

**Pattern A — Extended coinages (9–12 letters)**
Combine two morpheme fragments from the pools in §4.2. Neither fragment should be a common standalone word. Result must feel phonetically natural, not concatenated. 9–12 letters total.

**Pattern B — Phonetic respelling of a brand-relevant concept word**
Start from a real word in the source concept pool (§4.2). Apply at least one respelling rule: transpose an internal vowel; change a double consonant; replace the ending with an Italian-phonetic brand suffix (-ova, -ella, -ina, -ora, -eva, -elo, -ari, -eno); or truncate to two syllables and add a new suffix. Document: source word, meaning, rule(s) applied, resulting token.

**Pattern C — Non-obvious root blend**
Blend two phonotactically Italian fragments where neither is a common standalone word. Fragment 1: 3–5 letters, ends in vowel or soft consonant (l, r, n, v). Fragment 2: 3–6 letters, begins with vowel or soft consonant. Total: 7–11 letters. Must not accidentally form a word in any relevant language.

**Pattern D — Compound domain strategy**
Generate a shorter coined root (6–8 letters) and pair it with a brand suffix to form the domain: `<root><suffix>.com`. Permitted domain suffixes: co, studio, atelier, casa, arte, mano, filo. The spoken/wordmark name is the root; the domain is the compound. Score the root on all five dimensions. List both spoken name and domain string in output.

**Pattern E — Obscure real word (the Polène approach)**
Find a real word from a niche domain relevant to this business (see §4.2 for the source domains to mine). The word must: not be commonly known in commercial use; not be descriptive of the product in TM terms; have a story the operator can tell in 10 seconds; and sound premium and on-brand to the primary buyer. Cite the source and explain why it is non-descriptive.

### 4.2 Business-specific morpheme pools and source domains

**First-element morpheme pool (for Pattern A):**
Draw from coastal/movement/energy vocabulary rooted in Campanian Italian and Mediterranean geography. Each fragment is 4–7 characters, ends in a vowel or soft consonant, and feels phonetically consistent with Italian and English.

- `solan` (sun-adjacent)
- `lumen` (light, Latin root)
- `volan` (fly/movement)
- `orial` (coastal-adjacent)
- `cariv` (carry + movement blend)
- `novil` (new + light)
- `brion` (brio — energy/liveliness, Italian)
- `rivar` (shore/bank, Italian)
- `lumor` (light + movement blend)
- `velorn` (sail-adjacent, movement)
- `orand` (radiant, orangey warmth)
- `marol` (sea-adjacent)
- `ondav` (wave-adjacent, Italian onda)
- `filor` (wire/thread — filo, Italian; deliberately thin reference)
- `arcon` (arc of light)
- `celin` (sky-like, Italian cielo truncated)
- `vorav` (movement + avid blend)
- `lumin` (luminous root)
- `seran` (evening-adjacent, sera Italian)
- `rivol` (brook/trickle, rivo Italian)
- `aeran` (air, movement)
- `telen` (far-carrying)
- `altan` (high — alto Italian truncated)
- `cammin` (path/journey — cammino Italian)
- `porten` (to carry — portare Italian root)
- `briov` (energy/brightness blend)
- `galorn` (buoyant, movement)
- `floran` (flowing, flora-adjacent)

**Second-element morpheme pool (for Pattern A):**
Suffix fragments that complete Pattern A compounds. Vary lengths and endings; avoid over-indexing on -ella/-ina.

- `ova` (Italian suffix, suggests new/egg imagery)
- `ello` (Italian diminutive — warm, approachable)
- `ara` (open vowel ending, Mediterranean)
- `ino` (diminutive — familiar, Italian)
- `enza` (abstract noun suffix — Italian)
- `ivo` (active suffix — Italian)
- `alo` (open, sunny)
- `anda` (ongoing, present-tense feel)
- `uso` (in-use, Italian -uso suffix)
- `arro` (doubled resonant — energetic)
- `elli` (plural diminutive — friendly)
- `ori` (plural nominal — Italian)
- `ento` (movement suffix — Italian -mento variant)
- `ura` (quality/state — Italian -ura)
- `avia` (flight/air — Latin)
- `etto` (small, approachable)
- `ezzo` (half/middle — Italian mezzo truncated)
- `orno` (warmth — giorno/forno adjacent)

**Source concept pool (for Pattern B):**
Real words for respelling into new coinages. Each has Italian or Latin roots and connects to PWRB's territory.

| Word | Language | Meaning | Why relevant |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Carica` | Italian | charge (battery); also: load, burden | Direct battery reference — respell to soften/differentiate |
| `Vigore` | Italian | vigour, energy, vitality | Energy brand territory |
| `Moto` | Italian | movement, motion; also: motorbike | Movement + energy — risk of motorbike confusion, respell carefully |
| `Sole` | Italian | sun | Warmth, coastal, natural energy |
| `Luce` | Italian | light | Light = power; very on-brand |
| `Brio` | Italian/English | liveliness, energy, spirit | Brand personality word |
| `Flusso` | Italian | flow, current (electrical) | Electrical current + movement |
| `Onda` | Italian | wave | Coastal, movement |
| `Vela` | Italian | sail | Movement, coastal, carry |
| `Porto` | Italian | port/harbour; also: I carry (portare) | Both geographic and functional |
| `Forza` | Italian | force, strength | Energy, power |
| `Cima` | Italian | peak, summit | Highest point — aspirational |
| `Cella` | Italian/Latin | cell (biological and electrical) | Battery cell — disguised reference |
| `Brezza` | Italian | breeze | Light, coastal, movement |
| `Raggio` | Italian | ray (of light), radius | Light ray — energy without tech |
| `Volta` | Italian | turn/time; also Volta (inventor of battery) | Dual meaning: the Volta — inventor of the modern battery, coastal Italian heritage |
| `Pila` | Italian | battery, pile, stack | Most literal Italian word for battery — must be heavily respelled |
| `Aria` | Italian/English | air, melody | Light, breath, freedom |

**Source domains to mine (for Pattern E):**
These are niche domains where obscure but usable words for Pattern E might exist.

1. **Medieval Amalfi maritime republic vocabulary** — Amalfi was a major Mediterranean trading power (9th–12th century). Its maritime code (Tavole Amalfitane) introduced trade and navigation terminology that passed into Italian. Obscure terms for vessel parts, wind conditions, or navigation instruments.
2. **Campanian/Neapolitan dialect vocabulary** — Southern Italian dialects include pre-standardisation words for everyday objects, particularly around agriculture, fishing, and craft that have no equivalents in standard Italian.
3. **Historical Italian electrical engineering vocabulary (pre-1950)** — Early Italian physics and electrical engineering coined terminology before international standardisation. Terms from Volta, Galvani-era Italian scientific vocabulary that describe charge, current, or energy.
4. **Byzantine-Greek loanwords in southern Italian dialects** — Southern Italy has a documented Greek-speaking population (Griko) and Byzantine-era vocabulary in Calabria and Campania. Short, phonetically Italian-compatible words that carry a coastal/ancient feel.
5. **Arab-influenced vocabulary in medieval Italian maritime trade** — Amalfi traded extensively with Arab Mediterranean ports. Some Arabic-origin technical or navigational words entered Southern Italian vocabulary and have survived in obscure form.
6. **Latin botanical vocabulary for Mediterranean coastal plants** — Plants specific to the Amalfi Coast (lemon groves, myrtle, euphorbia on cliffs). Genus names or pre-Linnaean vernacular names that are beautiful, non-commercial, and tell a story.
7. **Venetian/Genoese maritime vocabulary** — Historic Italian maritime city-states shared navigational terminology. Terms for wind patterns, currents, or coastal features that are obsolete in modern use.
8. **Italian alchemy and natural philosophy (15th–17th century)** — Italian alchemical texts used coined vocabulary for energy transfer, transformation, and matter states — words that have no modern commercial footprint.

## §5. Hard blockers and elimination list

### 5.1 Domain availability gate (copy verbatim — do not rewrite)

.com availability at standard registration price is a prerequisite for shortlisting. Domain checking is a separate automated step (Part 3 of the pipeline) — the generation agent does NOT check domains. The agent generates and scores only.

**RDAP verification protocol (for Part 3):**
1. `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "https://rdap.verisign.com/com/v1/domain/<name>.com"` — 404 = unregistered, 200 = registered
2. For names passing step 1, confirm with a registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy) that the domain is at standard registration price, not broker/aftermarket pricing
3. Document: RDAP result, registrar result, date checked

.eu and .it are desirable but secondary. .com is the only hard gate.

### 5.2 Why short coinages fail (copy verbatim — do not rewrite)

Short pronounceable coinages (5–8 letters) with Romance-language phonotactics are almost entirely exhausted in the .com namespace. Domain investment funds systematically register every plausible 5–8 letter token with open vowels, soft consonants, and common suffixes. Three naming rounds for this business produced 80 candidates; 80/80 .com domains were taken.

**Length guidance for all patterns:**
- Prefer 9–12 letter tokens
- 6–8 letter tokens permitted only with Pattern D (compound domain) or Pattern E (obscure real word with verified domain)
- Do not generate 5-letter coinages

### 5.3 Eliminated names

None — first naming run.
