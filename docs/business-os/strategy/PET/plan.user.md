# Pet Product — Business Plan

## Strategy

### Current Focus (2026-02-12)

1. **Active Outcome Contract (Locked)** (Priority: High)
   - Outcome: Achieve first reliable PET sales in Italy via pre-website execution, then stabilize contribution-positive growth with bundle/attach economics.
   - Baseline: orders/revenue/CAC/returns not yet measured (week-0 baseline).
   - Target by 2026-05-13: 178 orders, EUR 5,874 gross revenue incl VAT, blended CAC <= EUR 10-12, return rate <= 8%.
   - Owner: Pete
   - Leading indicators: sessions by channel, CVR by channel, paid + blended CAC, payment success rate, on-time ship rate, return reason distribution.
   - Decision Link: `DEC-PET-01` (scale spend/channel breadth vs hold and fix).

2. **Category and Segment Prioritization** (Priority: High)
   - Status: Initial category options exist but no ranked decision set.
   - Next: Rank target segment and define primary offer scope for first validation cycle.
   - Artifact: `docs/business-os/strategy/PET/italy-90-day-launch-forecast-v2.user.md`
   - Exec Summary: `docs/business-os/strategy/PET/italy-90-day-launch-forecast-v2-exec-summary.user.md`

3. **Evidence and Tooling Baseline** (Priority: Medium)
   - Status: Demand, margin, and fulfillment instrumentation are not yet in place.
   - Next: Define minimum tooling/data stack needed for decision-grade signals.
   - Dry-run Evidence: `docs/business-os/strategy/PET/2026-02-11-week2-gate-dry-run.user.md`
   - Action Backlog: `docs/business-os/strategy/PET/launch-readiness-action-backlog.user.md`

## Risks

### Active Risks

- **Category Dilution** (Severity: High, Added: 2026-02-11)
  - Source: Broad category exploration without a constrained first bet.
  - Impact: Slow learning and fragmented execution.
  - Mitigation: Narrow scope to one primary segment and one validation channel.

- **Unmeasured Unit Economics** (Severity: Medium, Added: 2026-02-11)
  - Source: No current landed-cost and margin measurement baseline.
  - Impact: Risk of scaling low-margin work.
  - Mitigation: Define margin proxy and weekly tracking before expansion decisions.
