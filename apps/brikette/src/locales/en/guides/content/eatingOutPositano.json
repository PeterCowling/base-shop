    "Positano is packed with restaurants ranging from simple pizza counters to celebratory tasting menus. Prices rise as you head towards the main beach, so balance your plans between neighbourhood staples and destination dining.",
    "Reserve tables online through services like TheFork whenever possible and aim to confirm for 20:30–22:00, when dining rooms are busiest. For last-minute meals, keep a few walk-in options uphill from the waterfront."

Ride the Positano main beach shuttle boat over for a scenic arrival, or take the Amalfi-bound SITA bus and walk down from the stop. Expect exceptionally fresh catch and sunset views over Capri.",
        "For an unforgettable splurge, book the Sunset Cruise and Dinner. The outing includes a boat cruise, the coastal sunset, and a multi-course seafood feast for about €139 per person—ideal for special occasions or group celebrations."
