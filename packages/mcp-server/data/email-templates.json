These complaints were often vague and difficult to verify, which led to challenging decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nInitially, we attempted to be flexible with the policy, admitting guests who assured us they were easygoing. Unfortunately, despite their assurances, some of these guests later complained about noise levels.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result, we have decided to adhere more strictly to our policy during peak seasons to minimize risks and maintain a comfortable environment for all our guests. During the start and end of the season, when risks are more manageable, we can be more flexible.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge that this policy may not be ideal for everyone, but we believe it is preferable to the alternative.
