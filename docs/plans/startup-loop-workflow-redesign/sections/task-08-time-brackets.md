## If you have 10/30/60 minutes

Already familiar with the loop? Use this guide to decide what to work on today based on the time you have.

### 10 minutes — Check status and pick one action

- Read the Today panel for the business you want to move forward.
- Identify the single top blocker.
- Complete one concrete step toward that blocker: fill a field in the Operational Confirmations form, run a 5-minute GA4 check, or confirm one inventory number.
- Done: you have moved at least one blocker forward.

### 30 minutes — Complete a full checklist

- Pick one of these and run it end-to-end:
  - **GA4 measurement verification for BRIK** — open Standard Reports, check begin_checkout and web_vitals for last 7 days, run DebugView if needed, document outcome.
  - **Operational Confirmations for HEAD or PET** — fill all 6 required fields in the form and timestamp them.
  - **Baseline refresh review** — check whether any standing refresh prompt (market pulse, channel economics) is overdue and queue it.
- Done: the chosen checklist is complete and documented.

### 60 minutes — Produce a required artifact

- Pick one of these artifacts and produce it:
  - **Day-14 forecast recalibration** — update the BRIK 90-day forecast using measured week-1/2 actuals to replace seed assumptions.
  - **Weekly K/P/C/S decision** — run the weekly Keep/Pivot/Scale/Kill review for HEAD, PET, or BRIK and produce the decision document.
  - **Complete action card** — pick one business, work through all steps in its action card, and mark it done.
- Done: the artifact exists and is dated today.
