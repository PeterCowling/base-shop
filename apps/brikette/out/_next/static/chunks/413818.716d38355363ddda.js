The shortcut from %LINK:hostelBriketteToFornilloBeach|Hostel Brikette% arrives at the left-hand side of the beach (when facing the sea); the waterfront promenade from Spiaggia Grande reaches the right-hand side.","Beach clubs run in sequence from the hostel access point toward the main beach path: Pupetto, Da Ferdinando, Fratelli Grassi, and La Marinella. Two public zones bookend the lidos — a wide free stretch beside Pupetto and a smaller cove beyond La Marinella."]},{"id":"main-free","title":"Main free section","body":["The largest free section sits directly in front of the shortcut from the hostel. Arrive before 10:30 to claim a spot near the waterline; the pebbles warm quickly so pack a mat or thick towel.","Pupetto and Da Ferdinando both sell takeaway drinks and panini — perfect if you want food without renting a lounger. Keep an eye on the tide in shoulder months; autumn storms can shrink the shoreline for a day or two."]},{"id":"pupetto","title":"Pupetto Beach Club","body":["Pupetto anchors the left side of Fornillo with rows of orange loungers, showers, and a full-service restaurant. Reserve by WhatsApp or phone in summer if you want front-row seats; walk-ins are normally fine before 09:30.","Guests using the free area can still order takeaway from the bar, and Pupetto’s bathrooms are open to paying customers — handy if you decide to upgrade partway through the day."]},{"id":"ferdinando","title":"Da Ferdinando","body":["Da Ferdinando keeps a chilled beach-bar vibe with blue loungers, paddleboard rentals, and a popular lunch menu (think grilled catch of the day, salads, and pasta). Expect prices a little higher than Pupetto but still reasonable for Positano.","Water taxis to Laurito and Arienzo swing by Da Ferdinando’s jetty — useful if you plan to beach-hop after a morning swim."]},{"id":"grassi","title":"Fratelli Grassi Beach Bar","body":["Grassi is compact with neat rows of red loungers and a shaded bar for cocktails and granita. The team offers dry bags for valuables if you rent kayaks to explore the nearby caves.","Because space is limited, advance bookings help on weekends. Walk-ins are usually possible midweek after 11:00 once early reservations settle."]},{"id":"marinella","title":"La Marinella","body":["La Marinella sits closest to the Spiaggia Grande walkway and catches midday sun. Expect attentive service, lunch platters, and the option to book upper-deck loungers with extra shade.","In shoulder season La Marinella sometimes relocates a few chairs into the neighbouring cove. Staff should leave space for the public area, but be prepared for a tighter footprint when seas are rough."]},{"id":"secret-free","title":"‘Secret’ free section","body":["Beyond La Marinella, a small cove offers a quieter public area with a pebble shelf and calm water. Bring reef-friendly sunscreen and water shoes — the entry is rocky and sea urchins can cluster near the edges.","La Marinella occasionally sets spare loungers here on stormy days. The zone remains officially free, so feel comfortable using the space if you arrive first; just leave room for returning chairs or kayaks."]}],"essentialsTitle":"Essentials","essentials":["Suncream","Sunglasses","Towel"],"typicalCostsTitle":"Typical costs","typicalCosts":["Between 0 and 50 euros, depending on whether you rent a lounger, eat, or drink."],"tipsTitle":"Quick tips","tips":["Follow the %LINK:hostelBriketteToFornilloBeach|shortcut route% down for the fastest descent (15–20 minutes).","When you are ready to leave, take the %LINK:fornilloBeachToBrikette|return route% along the promenade and ride the interno bus back up to Chiesa Nuova.","Compare prices and alternative coves in our %LINK:positanoBeaches|Positano beaches overview% before you book loungers."],"warningsTitle":"Good to know","warnings":["Fornillo is pebbled — pack water shoes or sandals for the shoreline.","Shade is limited after late morning, so plan to rent a parasol or bring a hat and sunscreen.","Card machines occasionally go offline; carry some cash for bar tabs and lounger balances."],"faqsTitle":"Fornillo FAQs","faqs":[{"q":"Do I need to reserve a lounger?","a":["Reservations help on summer weekends. Pupetto and La Marinella answer by phone or WhatsApp; Da Ferdinando and Grassi also monitor Instagram DMs. Early arrivals before 09:30 can usually grab walk-in spots."]},{"q":"Can I bring my own food?","a":["Picnics are welcome in the free sections. If you rent loungers, stick to small snacks and water bottles unless the club confirms otherwise. Every operator has a bar or restaurant for larger meals."]},{"q":"Where can I shower or use the bathroom?","a":["Facilities belong to each beach club. Ask at the bar before using them if you are in the public zone — many allow quick visits for a small fee or when you buy food or drinks."]}]}')}}]);
