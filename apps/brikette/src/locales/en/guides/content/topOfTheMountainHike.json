        "From the crossroads at the top of the village, turn right up the paved lane until a junction, then turn left and continue past the restaurant until the road bends sharply left.",
        "Leave the road on the right-hand side, following the side path that drops slightly between houses. It will feel like private property at first, but you are still on the right track.",
        "Stay on the mountain trail for an extended stretch until you reach a signed crossroads. Ignore the downhill options and take the steeply rising path.",
        "The ascent quickly zig-zags before easing into a long, flatter traverse along the left-hand side of the mountain face. When you spot stone-cut steps on your right, follow them around the back of the peak for the final push.",
        "Those rock steps lead to the last ramp of the day—keep climbing and you will emerge on the summit plateau with panoramic views in every direction."

    "At least 2 litres of water per person plus salty snacks; there are no reliable refills after Santa Maria del Castello.",

  "tipsTitle": "Smart timing",
  "tips": [
    "Start at dawn in summer to avoid climbing under peak heat; late autumn and spring afternoons offer softer light without the scorching sun.",
    "Check the forecast for storms—cloud cover can erase the views and wet rock makes the summit steps slippery.",
    "Let someone at the hostel know your plan and expected return time before you set off."

  "warningsTitle": "When to reconsider",
  "warnings": [
    "Skip the hike if you lack mountain experience or strong fitness; the sustained elevation gain is punishing and there are few bailout points.",
    "Avoid the route if heights unsettle you—exposed ledges and steep drops challenge even confident hikers.",
    "Do not attempt the summit during peak summer afternoons when heat and the need to carry extra water add to the strain."
