# HBAG Market Intelligence — Latest

## MARKET-02 — Demand evidence (current)

`docs/business-os/market-research/HBAG/market-02-demand-evidence.user.md`

**Status: Draft** — Created 2026-02-23.
Key finding: bag charm trend active but maturing — shifting from novelty/character to craft/texture-led
executions. Etsy shows active buyer intent signals (favourites, "in carts", "low stock") on charm-adjacent
listings. AirPods case category commoditised (3,000+ Etsy items, mostly below $50). Apple AirPods Pro 3
released Sep 2025 — Q1 2026 demand may be tail of that wave. Amalfi tourist season June–September confirmed.

## MARKET-01 — Competitor mapping

`docs/business-os/market-research/HBAG/market-01-competitor-mapping.user.md`

**Status: Draft** — 10 competitors mapped (7 Etsy-native, 3 DTC). Created 2026-02-23.
Key finding: mini handbag-shaped charms on Etsy cluster <$30; premium €80–€150 bag charm space
is dominated by bag jewellery (pearls/chains) and leather tech cases — not handbag-silhouette charms.
This is both a competitive risk (cheap lookalikes) and a price/quality wedge opportunity.

## Prior baseline

`docs/business-os/market-research/HBAG/2026-02-20-market-intelligence.user.md`

**Status: Superseded** — S2 backfill from `mini-handbag-pmf` fact-find (2026-02-17). Still valid
for H1/H2 market signals; now supplemented by MARKET-01 and MARKET-02 above.
