  "intro": [
    "Hitchhiking on the Amalfi Coast sounds adventurous, but the SS163 is narrow with blind bends and almost no safe pull‑offs.",
    "Lean on the public transport network instead: carry validated tickets, plan backup routes, and keep emergency cash for taxis or porters if services stop."

        "Coaches, buses, and scooters already share a single lane carved into the cliff. Drivers cannot see you in time and police will often move people along for their own safety.",
        "Night visibility is poor and shoulders are tiny — waiting on the carriageway risks injury and fines."

        "SITA buses, local shuttles, and community vans run all day; buy tickets ahead at tabacchi and validate on board.",
        "Seasonal ferries give scenic hops between towns; when seas cancel them, revert to bus + porter service or shared taxis.",
        "Short walking paths (Nocelle ↔ Positano, Praiano ↔ coastal hamlets) provide scenic backups in daylight."

        "Call a licensed taxi (numbers are posted at major stops) or ask your accommodation/hostel bar to book one; late‑night rates are higher, so split fares with other travellers when possible.",

    "Screenshot bus and ferry schedules from UnicoCampania or Travelmar each morning so you know the last guaranteed departure.",
    "Carry a small torch or reflective band if you expect to walk after sunset — roadside lighting is limited."

    "Never wait inside tunnels or on blind bends — local police can fine you and drivers have no space to avoid pedestrians."

      "a": [
        "There’s no explicit regional ban, but law enforcement discourages it and may ask you to move for safety. If officers intervene, follow their instructions and relocate to a bus stop."

    {
      "q": "What if the last bus has already left?",
      "a": [
        "Use posted taxi numbers, rideshare apps that operate locally, or ask nearby hotels/bars to call a driver. As a final fallback, ride to Amalfi or Sorrento (larger towns) where night buses and trains are more frequent."
