<Description>
This page demonstrates the Product Listing Page (PLP) composition using the client Collection section.

Slots and structure:

- HeaderSection — sticky variant with inline search (optional breadcrumbs/currency/locale as needed)
- Main — CollectionSection (client) with facets sidebar, sort selector, product grid, and optional SEO text block
- FooterSection — choose a preset (e.g. legal‑heavy)

Pagination modes:

- <b>loadMore</b> (client) — renders a button to append more results in place
- <b>ssr</b> — server‑friendly paging via <code>?page</code>/<code>?pageSize</code>, with Previous/Next controls

The composition story below uses MSW to mock <code>/api/collections/:slug</code> responses so it runs offline in Storybook.
