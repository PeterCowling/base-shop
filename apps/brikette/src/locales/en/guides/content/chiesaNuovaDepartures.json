If you are heading towards Sorrento (west), you'll wait directly outside the bar itself on the mountain side of the road.",

From Amalfi, you can continue to %LINK:salernoPositano|Salerno% (additional 45 minutes) or take connecting buses to Ravello.",

        "**First buses:** The first eastbound bus towards Amalfi typically departs Chiesa Nuova around 6:30–7:00am. The first westbound bus towards Sorrento usually leaves around 6:45–7:15am. Check the current timetable at Bar Internazionale or with hostel reception as schedules vary seasonally.",
        "**Last buses:** Evening services thin out considerably after 10pm. The last bus towards Amalfi usually departs around 10:30pm, while the last Sorrento-bound bus leaves around 11pm. Always check the exact times at reception or on the SITA timetable, and plan to catch the second-to-last service if you're traveling in the evening to avoid being stranded.",
        "**Winter schedules (November–March):** Frequency drops to every 40–60 minutes, with earlier last buses. Some evening services may not run at all on Sundays or public holidays."

        "**Ticket prices (2026):** A single journey from Positano to Amalfi costs €2.50. Positano to Sorrento costs €2.50. Positano to Salerno (via Amalfi) costs €4.00. A 24-hour Costiera pass costs €8.00 and covers unlimited travel between Sorrento and Salerno.",
        "**Validation:** Present your ticket to the driver as you board, who will stamp it with the date and time. On newer buses, you may scan your ticket at the electronic validator just inside the door. Keep your validated ticket for the entire journey—inspectors regularly check tickets and issue on-the-spot fines for unvalidated or missing tickets.",
        "**Buy ahead:** If you're catching the first bus out in the morning (before 7:30am), buy your ticket the day before, as the tabacchi may not be open yet. Come to hostel reception to arrange an early checkout if needed.",

        "**Queue etiquette:** Form an orderly line near the bus shelter on the correct side of the road. Don't push or crowd—Italians generally respect queue order. When the bus arrives, wait for passengers to alight before boarding.",
        "**Luggage:** There's limited luggage space on SITA buses—usually a small compartment at the back or under-seat storage only. If you're traveling with large backpacks or suitcases, try to board early to claim a luggage spot. Consider using a %LINK:porterServices|porter service% to transport luggage to your next destination if you're carrying heavy bags.",
        "**Standing room:** On packed summer buses, you may need to stand for part or all of the journey. The coastal road is winding with sharp bends, so hold on tightly to overhead rails or seat backs."

Total journey time: approximately 2 hours. See our %LINK:positanoNaplesCenterBusTrain|complete Positano to Naples guide% for schedules and platform information.",
        "**To Naples Airport:** Follow the Naples route above, then take the Alibus shuttle from Naples Central Station to the airport (20 minutes). Alternatively, book a direct shuttle from Positano—ask at reception. Our %LINK:naplesAirportPositanoBus|Naples Airport guide% covers all options.",
        "**To Salerno:** Take the eastbound bus towards Amalfi (35 minutes), then continue on the same or a connecting bus to Salerno (45 minutes).

See our %LINK:ferrySchedules|ferry schedules guide% for timetables and our %LINK:briketteToFerryDock|walking route to the dock%.",

        "**Scooter rental:** Experienced riders can rent a scooter in Positano and drive the coastal road themselves. See our %LINK:scooterRentalPositano|scooter rental guide% for rental shops, pricing, and safety tips. Not recommended for nervous riders—the SS163 coastal road is narrow and winding with heavy traffic in summer."
