# Brand Name Decision — HEAD

## Decision

**Selected brand name: Facilella**

- Domain: facilella.com (AVAILABLE — RDAP confirmed 2026-02-26)
- Score: 24/25 (D=5, W=5, P=5, E=4, I=5)
- Pattern: C (fragment blend)
- Territory: Easy Hair System
- Provenance: facil(e)+ella — effortless, child-run
- Round: 7 (of 7 naming rounds)

## Rationale

Facilella scored the joint-highest in Round 7 (24/25) and passed the ICP resonance gate with I=5. The Easy Hair System territory anchors the name in the primary differentiator — a CI accessory kit that a child manages independently, without caregiver intervention. The -ella suffix gives it strong Italian-language phonetics and wordmark clarity while keeping the English reading natural (fah-chi-LEL-ah). The facile- root is immediately legible to an Italian caregiver parent without being clinical or spa-coded.
