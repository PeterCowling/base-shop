# Assets

Current handbag model:

- `v1/desktop.gltf` + `v1/mobile.gltf` are the current photoreal handbag assets.
  Textures + buffers are external files under `v1/` so they can be cached
  immutably (publish changes under `v2/`, `v3/`, etc).
- `mobile.glb` + `desktop.glb` are older lightweight placeholders generated by
  `apps/handbag-configurator/scripts/generate-handbag-assets.mjs` and are kept
  for reference only.
- The legacy suitcase source assets remain in
  `products/bag-001/assets/source/vintage_suitcase/` for reference only.

Runtime conventions:

- Asset resolution is driven by the `assets` block in
  `products/bag-001/config.schema.json`, which supports base tiers and part swaps.
- Part swaps can be triggered either by `assetBindings` on config values or by
  `selectionBindings` rules in the assets manifest.
- For part swaps, author empty slot nodes (e.g. `slot_body`, `slot_handle`) in the
  base glTF and align part glTF origins to those pivots so attachments snap into
  place.
- For open/close transitions, include animation clips named `Open` and `Close`
  (or update the manifest to match the authored clip names). If no clips are
  present, the `proceduralOpen` block in the manifest drives a hinge rotation on
  `Body_Flap`.
- If `proceduralOpen.pivot` is omitted, the viewer rotates the named node around
  its authored pivot (recommended when `Body_Flap` is authored on the hinge line).
- If `proceduralOpen.pivot` is provided, values are normalized (0 = min bound, 1 =
  max bound) on the target node's bounding box and a temporary pivot wrapper is
  inserted at runtime.
- Handle part assets live under `assets/parts/` for the `handleStyle` swap; the
  base handle is hidden while a handle part is active via `hideBaseMeshes`.
- Monogram parts live under `assets/parts/` and are toggled by the `monogram`
  property via `assetBindings`.
- Material changes are driven by `materialBindings` in the config schema and the
  preset map in `apps/handbag-configurator/src/viewer/materials/materialPresets.ts`.

Other assets:

- `poster.jpg` is from Poly Haven (CC0), using the `photo_studio_01` set.
- `hdri/studio_01.hdr` is Poly Haven `brown_photostudio_04` (CC0) to provide a
  warmer product studio environment.
