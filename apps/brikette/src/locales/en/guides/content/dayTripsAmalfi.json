    "Positano works brilliantly as a day-trip base—ferries and buses connect you to Capri, Pompeii, Amalfi, Ravello, and Sorrento within 30-90 minutes. Most trips cost €15-35 for transport plus site entry, and you'll avoid hauling luggage or changing hostels.",
    "Start early to beat cruise crowds, pre-book tickets for Pompeii and popular ferries, and always keep a weather backup plan (ferries cancel in rough seas). Pack snacks, water, sunscreen, and a light rain jacket—cafés near tourist sites charge premium prices."

        "Capri: Most expensive (€20 ferry each way, ~€35-40 total with funicular/chairlift), most scenic, needs full day. Best for: iconic views, photos, hiking to Arco Naturale or Villa Jovis. %LINK:capriDayTrip|Full Capri day trip guide%",
        "Pompeii: Best value (€9 bus to Sorrento, €2.50 train, €18 entry = ~€32 total), history-rich, 3-4 hours on site. Best for: archaeology buffs, early starters who want afternoon back in Positano. %LINK:positanoPompeii|Positano to Pompeii directions%",
        "Amalfi + Ravello: Easy combo (€8 ferry or €4 bus to Amalfi, €2.50 bus up to Ravello), food and gardens. Best for: shorter half-day trips, sunset views from Villa Cimbrone. %LINK:positanoAmalfi|Positano to Amalfi transport%",
        "Sorrento: Relaxed vibe (€12 ferry or €4 bus), lemon groves, limoncello, seafood, Villa Comunale viewpoint. Best for: market shopping, food tastings, late-morning departures. %LINK:naplesPositano|Naples-Positano connections via Sorrento%",
        "Herculaneum: Smaller than Pompeii (€9 bus to Sorrento, €2.50 train, €13 entry = ~€27 total), better-preserved mosaics, 2-3 hours on site. Best for: seeing ruins without Pompeii crowds."

        "Why go: Iconic cliffside views, Faraglioni rock stacks, Blue Grotto (weather permitting), boutique shopping in Capri town, hiking trails, and hillside gardens. Capri is the most photogenic day trip, but also the priciest—expect to spend €50-70 total including transport, funicular/chairlift, and a modest lunch.",
        "Best for: Clear-weather days when you want dramatic coastal scenery and don't mind tourist crowds. Photographers should aim for morning or late-afternoon light.",
        "Getting there: Take the first ferry from Positano (usually 08:15-09:00, €20 each way, 40 minutes, %LINK:ferryCancellations|check ferry status% at Positano ferry dock or online). Book a day or two ahead in summer—morning sailings sell out. Return ferries run until 18:00-19:00 depending on season. %LINK:briketteToFerryDock|Walk from hostel to ferry dock% takes 10-15 minutes.",
        "Money-saving moves: Skip the Blue Grotto (€18 entry plus €15-20 for the rowboat, often closed due to waves)—the views from land are stunning and free. Bring a packed lunch from Positano supermarkets (avoid overpriced island cafés). Walk between Capri town and Anacapri instead of taking the bus (steep but saves €4 round-trip).",
        "Suggested itinerary: Arrive early, take funicular up to Capri town (€2 each way, included in some ferry packages), walk to Giardini di Augusto (€1 entry) for Faraglioni views before 10:00 when tour groups arrive. Bus or walk to Anacapri (€2 bus each way), ride Monte Solaro chairlift (€13 round-trip, opens 09:30) for 360° panoramas. Explore Villa San Michele or hike to Arco Naturale (free, 20 minutes from Capri town), then catch the 17:00-18:00 ferry back. Weather backup: If ferries cancel, explore Sorrento or take the bus to Amalfi instead.",
        "Local tips from the hostel: Pack a swimsuit—there are rocky swimming spots near Faraglioni and Marina Piccola if you have extra time. Avoid peak summer weekends (July-August Saturdays) when day-trippers triple. Check %LINK:ferryCancellations|ferry schedules% the night before and screenshot them—mobile signal is patchy on Capri cliffs."

        "Best for: History lovers, early risers (sites open at 09:00, arrive then to beat tour buses), anyone wanting a half-day trip with afternoon back in Positano.",
        "Getting there: Take the %LINK:sitaTickets|SITA bus% from Positano to Sorrento (€4, 50 minutes, departs from %LINK:chiesaNuovaDepartures|Chiesa Nuova% or Positano Sponda stop depending on your location). From Sorrento, board the Circumvesuviana train toward Napoli and get off at Pompei Scavi-Villa dei Misteri (€2.50, 35 minutes, trains every 30 minutes) or Ercolano Scavi for Herculaneum (€2.50, 20 minutes). Walk 5-10 minutes from each station to the site entrance.",
        "Costs: Pompeii entry €18 (book online to skip ticket queues), Herculaneum €13, plus ~€13 round-trip transport from Positano. Total: €31-32 for Pompeii, €26-27 for Herculaneum.",
        "Money-saving moves: Buy Pompeii tickets online at least a day ahead (www.ticketone.it or official Pompeii site) to avoid 30-60 minute queue in peak season. Bring your own water (1.5L per person) and snacks—there's one café inside Pompeii charging €5 for a panini. Wear a hat and sunscreen—excavations have zero shade and summer temps hit 35°C. If you're under 25 and EU resident, check for youth discounts.",
        "Suggested itinerary (Pompeii): Catch the 07:30 or 08:00 bus from Positano, arrive at Pompeii by 09:30, spend 3-4 hours walking the Forum, Stabian Baths, House of the Faun, Villa of the Mysteries, and Amphitheatre. Head back to Sorrento around 13:30, grab lunch there or return to Positano by 15:00. You can also climb Vesuvius (€10 entry, 20 minutes from Pompeii by Vesuvio Express bus €10 round-trip) if you have energy—views are spectacular but add 2-3 hours to your day.",
        "Suggested itinerary (Herculaneum): Smaller site means 2-3 hours is enough. Arrive by 10:00, explore the perfectly preserved mosaics, wooden fixtures, and two-story houses, then return to Positano by early afternoon. Pair with a Sorrento stop on the way back for lunch and lemon grove walks.",
        "Local tips from the hostel: Circumvesuviana trains are basic (no AC, graffiti, pickpockets in crowded carriages)—keep valuables in a front pocket or daypack on your chest. Download offline maps for Pompeii (it's huge and confusing). If it's a scorching day (35°C+), Herculaneum's covered walkways make it more bearable."

Easy to pair both in one day, and the 5110 bus ride up to Ravello is a white-knuckle hairpin experience.",

        "Getting there: Ferry from Positano to Amalfi (€8, 20-30 minutes, multiple departures 08:00-18:00, more frequent April-October) or %LINK:sitaTickets|SITA bus% (€4, 40 minutes, slower but cheaper). From Amalfi port or bus stop, walk to the main square and catch the SITA 5110 bus up to Ravello (€2.50, 25 minutes, hairpin bends, departs hourly).

        "Costs: €8-16 round-trip transport (ferry is faster, bus is cheaper), plus €10 entry to Villa Cimbrone or €7 for Villa Rufolo. Total: €18-26 depending on choices.",
        "Money-saving moves: Skip the villas if you're on a tight budget—Ravello's public terraces (Piazza Duomo, belvedere near the main church) have free sweeping views. Pack a picnic lunch from Positano and eat in Ravello's gardens or on a bench overlooking the cliffs. Take the bus both ways to save €8 vs round-trip ferry—just budget extra time for winding roads and potential queues.",
        "Suggested itinerary: Take the 09:00-10:00 ferry or bus to Amalfi, explore the Duomo (free entry to main nave, €3 for Cloister of Paradise), wander the old town lanes, then catch the 12:00 or 13:00 bus up to Ravello. Visit Villa Cimbrone (the Terrace of Infinity is the highlight—arrive mid-afternoon for softer light), stroll through Ravello's Piazza Duomo, and catch the 17:00-18:00 bus back to Amalfi. Take a twilight ferry back to Positano (queues shrink after 18:00) or the last bus around 19:30-20:00.",
        "Weather backup: If ferries are cancelled, take the bus—it runs in almost all conditions. If you only have 2-3 hours, visit Amalfi solo and skip Ravello (or reverse it and go straight to Ravello for sunset views).",
        "Local tips from the hostel: Ravello hosts summer classical music concerts (Ravello Festival, June-September) in Villa Rufolo's gardens—check the schedule if you want to stay late. The 5110 bus gets packed in summer; queue early or stand near the front of the line. If you're prone to motion sickness, sit near the front and keep eyes on the horizon."

        "Money-saving moves: Skip overpriced limoncello shops in the main square—walk 10 minutes to local alimentari (grocery stores) for €8-10 bottles vs €15-20 tourist prices. Eat at family-run trattorie on side streets (Via Fuoro, Via Tasso side alleys) instead of marina-front restaurants—same food, half the price. The Villa Comunale terrace and Marina Grande beach are free and perfect for picnics.",
        "Suggested itinerary: Take the 10:00-11:00 ferry or bus, arrive in Sorrento by 11:30, explore the morning market (if it's Thursday), wander lemon groves near the town center (some offer free tastings), visit Sedil Dominova (free historic building with frescoed ceilings), have lunch at a side-street trattoria, then walk to Villa Comunale for clifftop views and photos. Catch the 16:00-17:00 ferry or 18:00 bus back to Positano. If you pair this with Pompeii, visit the ruins first (early morning) and arrive in Sorrento around 13:00-14:00 for late lunch and sunset.",
        "Weather backup: Sorrento is accessible by bus even if ferries are cancelled—it's the most reliable day trip for rough-weather days.",
        "Local tips from the hostel: Marina Grande (Sorrento's small fishing beach) is a 10-minute walk down steep steps from town—worth it for colorful boats, fewer tourists, and decent seafood lunch. If you're buying limoncello or ceramics, ask the hostel for recommendations on non-touristy shops. Sorrento's gelato (I Giardini di Cataldo, Davide Gelato) is some of the best on the coast—budget €3-4 for a cone."

        "Weather backup plans: %LINK:ferryCancellations|Ferry cancellations% are common in spring/autumn storms. Always have a bus alternative ready, or swap coastal trips (Capri, Amalfi via ferry) for inland ones (Pompeii, Sorrento via bus) if seas are rough. Check ferry status the night before and morning of your trip—ask at the hostel or check online schedules.",
        "Pack smart: Water (1L+ per person), snacks (tourist-site cafés are expensive), sunscreen, hat, light rain jacket (summer storms hit fast), and a small daypack. Wear comfortable walking shoes—Pompeii and Capri involve 2-4 hours of walking on uneven stone.",

        "Food and drink costs: Budget €10-15 for lunch if you eat at local spots, €5-7 for a coffee/gelato break, and carry your own water. Avoid marina-front and main-square restaurants unless you're treating yourself—walk 5-10 minutes inland for 30-50% cheaper meals.",
        "Pair trips smartly: Amalfi + Ravello (easy combo, same direction). Sorrento + Pompeii or Herculaneum (on the same train line). Capri is best solo—it's a full day and can't be rushed. Avoid pairing Capri with anything else unless you only do a quick island loop.",
        "Student and youth discounts: If you're under 25 and EU resident, bring ID for discounted entry to Pompeii, Herculaneum, and some villas. Non-EU students with ISIC cards may get discounts at Pompeii—ask at the ticket desk.",
        "Return transport timing: Check last ferry/bus times before you leave Positano. Ferries stop around 18:00-19:00 (earlier off-season), buses run later but are slower. Missing the last ferry means a 50-90 minute bus ride back—not a disaster but cuts into your evening."

        "Capri and Pompeii benefit most from first departures—both get crowded by mid-morning and involve more travel time. Aim to leave Positano by 08:00-08:30 for these. Amalfi, Ravello, and Sorrento are more flexible and work well with 10:00-11:00 departures."

      "q": "Can I fit two towns into one day?",
      "a": [
        "Yes—Amalfi and Ravello pair perfectly (same direction, 25-minute bus between them). Sorrento and Pompeii or Herculaneum also work well (same train line). Avoid stacking Capri with anything else—give it a full day. If you try to squeeze two unrelated destinations (e.g., Capri + Pompeii), you'll spend all day in transit and miss the best parts of both."

      "q": "What if ferries are cancelled due to weather?",
      "a": [
        "Take the SITA bus instead—it runs in almost all conditions. Swap Capri (ferry-only access) for a bus-accessible trip like Pompeii, Sorrento, or Amalfi/Ravello. Check ferry status the night before and morning of your trip by asking at the hostel or checking online schedules. Always have a backup plan."

      "q": "Which day trip is cheapest?",
      "a": [
        "Pompeii or Herculaneum are the best value (€26-32 total including transport and entry). Amalfi via bus (€8 round-trip if you skip villa entries) and Sorrento via bus with a picnic lunch (€15-20 total) are also budget-friendly. Capri is the most expensive (€50-70+ including ferry, funicular/chairlift, and food)."

      "q": "Do I need to book transport or site tickets in advance?",
      "a": [
        "Pre-book Pompeii tickets online to skip queues (30-60 minutes in peak season). Book Capri ferries 1-2 days ahead in July-August—morning sailings sell out. Bus tickets for SITA routes (Positano-Sorrento, Amalfi-Ravello) are bought onboard or at tabacchi shops and don't need advance booking. Ferry tickets to Amalfi or Sorrento can usually be bought same-day at the dock, but check availability if it's a summer weekend."

      "q": "Can I store luggage anywhere if I'm doing a day trip before/after check-in or check-out?",
      "a": [
        "Yes—Hostel Brikette offers free luggage storage for guests on arrival/departure days. If you're checking out and doing a day trip before leaving the coast, store your bags at the hostel and pick them up when you return. Pompeii, Sorrento, and Amalfi also have paid luggage storage services (€5-8 per bag per day) near train/ferry terminals if needed."
