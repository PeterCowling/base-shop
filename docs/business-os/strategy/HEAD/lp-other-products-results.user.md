# Italy-first Range + Naming Strategy (Non-Medical CI Processor Retention Brand)

_As of 20 Feb 2026 (Europe/Rome). Launch sequence: Italy -> EU -> US._

This artifact consolidates prior range and naming research into one loop-ready narrative with strict separation between:
- checked facts,
- strategic inferences,
- unknowns requiring supplier quotes, lab testing, and/or legal counsel.

No medical efficacy claims are made. This is not legal advice.

## 1) Executive summary

### Range thesis

Build a coherent product architecture around one organising idea:

> Secure wear + calmer routines + confident personal style (made to be seen).

This aligns with:
- day-to-day caregiver and user friction,
- existing manufacturer accessory ecosystems (retention, water-use, storage, routine care),
- EU MDR intended-purpose guardrails where copy framing and intent language are decisive risk levers.

### Market pattern (checked)

- Manufacturers already cover broad accessory stacks (retention lines, clips, headbands, cases, water-use covers), usually with compatibility-led and function-led naming.
- Independent brands compete strongest in textiles (headbands, sleeves/covers, decorative personalisation), often at lower price points.
- Gap: a cohesive lifestyle-led system with stronger routine design, bundles, instructions, and caregiver-first merchandising.

### Top opportunities (prioritised)

1. Textile-first repeatables (multi-packs, premium fabrics, seasonal drops)
2. Storage and organisation (pouches, parts pods, school kits)
3. Retention add-ons (child-safe breakaway tether ecosystem) after safety governance is complete

### Practical regulatory implication (checked + inferred)

EU MDR intended purpose includes promotional/sales statements; accessory interpretation is intent-based. Practical control surface = product language and framing discipline, not only physical product form.

## 2) Research transparency

### Checked (accessed 20 Feb 2026)

- EU MDR definitions and intent/accessory framing via EUR-Lex references and secondary guidance
- Manufacturer + community evidence for retention, sleep routines, moisture care, and storage pain points
- Manufacturer + EU retail price anchors (retention, water-use, cases)
- Independent competitor assortment and positioning patterns
- Italy/global installed-base references
- EUIPO TMview guidance and Nice-class references
- Evidence that "Hearing/Ear/Hear Solutions" naming strings skew clinic/hearing-aid context

### Inferred

- Best adjacent categories for small DTC operating model
- Claim-drift risk ratings as messaging heuristics (not classification outcomes)
- Pricing bands for proposed cards based on public anchors (not supplier-confirmed economics)

### Unknown without further work

- MOQ/COGS by fabric/hardware
- wash durability, irritation comfort, colourfastness
- child safety engineering validation for tether systems and small parts
- final legal treatment of each SKU under exact claims/labeling
- final trademark/domain clearance at filing and purchase time

## 3) Jobs-to-be-done map (evidence-led)

Recurring jobs across caregivers (primary) and active adults (secondary):

1. Keep processors secure during movement (school run, play, sport)
2. Reduce toddler pull-off incidents and downstream chaos
3. Make handovers reliable across multiple caregivers
4. Handle hats/helmets layering without slippage/discomfort
5. Stabilise sport/sweat moments and simplify post-activity routine
6. Support water-day organisation while complementing manufacturer water covers
7. Run a calm bedtime loop (off -> store -> ready)
8. Prevent loss of small accessory parts
9. Enable confident personal style without concealment framing
10. Create predictable non-medical replenishment triggers (lost, outgrown, worn)

## 4) Competitive + manufacturer accessory landscape (condensed)

- School kit EUR59-79
- Sport kit EUR45-65
- Bedtime routine kit EUR39-55
- Travel/water-day kit EUR45-70

## 9) Copy and sensitivity guardrails

### Do

- "Comfortable, secure wear for busy days"
- "Helps reduce drops and where-did-it-go moments"
- "Made to be worn proudly"

### Avoid

- Hearing outcome/treatment language
- "Essential for implant to work" framing
- concealment-first framing (hide/invisible/discreet) as primary promise

## 10) Risk register

### Claim-drift boundary (checked)

- Intended purpose is shaped by labels, IFU, and promotional/sales statements
- Accessory definition is intent-based
- Cleaning/disinfection intent can elevate regulatory stakes

### Safety risk (checked)

- Lanyard-style systems in manufacturer ecosystems include neck injury/strangulation warnings
- Tether products require strict safety design and caregiver guidance

### Operational implication (inferred)

- Lowest-risk near-term categories: textiles, personalisation, storage/organisation
- Highest-risk categories: products implying medical functionality and device-protection claims

## 11) Naming problem statement

Naming system requirements:
- signal comfort + secure wear + normalisation without clinical tone
- avoid claim-drift gravity and hearing-outcome verbs
- Italian-readable and extensible to EU/US
- avoid generic crowded clinic-coded structures (e.g., Hearing/Ear/Hear Solutions)

Hard constraints:
- no "cochlear" in masterbrand
- avoid identity/audiology labels by default
- avoid concealment framing

## 12) Naming evidence highlights

### Checked

- Italy installed-base references ~17k-20k (range, not single-registry truth)
- Global installed-base references ~1 million (milestone framing)
- TMview is EUIPO-recommended for pre-filing checks
- Nice Class 25 and Class 10 relevance confirmed

### Negative case (checked + inferred)

"Hearing Solutions / Ear Solutions / Hear Solutions" patterns strongly overlap with hearing clinics and hearing-aid providers.

Implication:
- chronic intent mismatch and clinic confusion,
- higher risk of copy drifting into medical-claim language,
- weaker ownability and category differentiation for lifestyle accessories.

## 13) Naming territories

1. Retention/security language (medium claim-drift risk)
2. Lifestyle/everyday normalisation with coined masterbrand (recommended first)
3. Inclusive identity-led naming (use cautiously; community-validated only)
4. Sensory/sound metaphor (higher discipline required)
5. Coined/invented Italian-friendly forms (highest ownability potential)

## 14) Two-layer naming system (recommended)

### Masterbrand

- Coined lifestyle name (non-clinical)

### Product-family descriptors

- Softband
- Hardband
- Organiser Pouch
- Patch Pack
- Parts Pods
- Clip Kit (after safety validation)

This separation keeps functional clarity in product lines while protecting masterbrand distinctiveness.

## 15) Naming shortlist directions (not cleared)

Territory-B-first shortlist directions:
- Nidilo
- Nidela
- Telilo
- Tessilo
- Tramilo
- Calafilo
- Filocalma
- Nuvafilo

Notes:
- `Nidela` surfaced external non-related usage in web checks; clearance needed.
- No trademark/domain clearance is implied for any candidate.

## 16) Fast kill-screen checklist

- If the name lands as clinic/hearing-aid context -> kill
- If it implies medical outcomes/functionality -> kill
- If obvious namespace collision emerges -> deprioritise/kill
- Run TMview pre-search before design/packaging investment

## 17) Naming workshop brief

Generate 30-50 coined two-root blends anchored in:
- wrap, weave, thread, nest, comfort, play, routine

Non-negotiables:
- no hearing/medical/cochlear terms in masterbrand
- no outcome verbs
- no concealment language

Output target:
- 10-12 for TM/domain knock-out
- 5-8 for counsel-level clearance

## 18) Appendix A — Working coined blend list

## 20) Final caution

This artifact is strategy evidence and operating guidance, not legal advice and not a medical claim framework. Before tether-class launch, complete child-safety engineering, legal review of intended-purpose language, and targeted QA validation.
