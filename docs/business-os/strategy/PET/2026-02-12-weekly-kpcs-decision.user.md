# PET Weekly K/P/C/S Decision

## A) KPI Delta Summary

- Week-0 initialization (no live sales metrics yet).
- Baseline remains: orders 0, revenue 0, CAC unmeasured, returns unmeasured.

## B) Decision

Decision: **Continue**.

Rationale:
- Outcome contract is now locked.
- Intake, market intelligence, site-upgrade brief, baseline seed, and prioritization scorecard are active.
- Near-term priority is execution + instrumentation to generate observed economics.

## C) What Changed This Week

Signal:
- PET startup-loop foundations are now in place (intake packet, blocker interview, scorecard).
- Clear P1 execution sequence exists for conversion surface, offer tests, and ops gate validation.

Noise:
- No observed week-1 channel economics yet.

## D) Next-Week Action Plan

1. Confirm exact launch inventory date and unit count.
2. Finalize launch price architecture (single/bundle/threshold).
3. Launch conversion surface with instrumentation.
4. Run price + messaging test matrix with daily reporting.
5. Validate payment success, shipping SLA, and return reason tracking.

## E) Risk Watchlist

- Hardware/closure reliability risk before scale.
- Pricing/offer mismatch risk causing low conversion.
- Insufficient measured data risk delaying recalibration.

## F) Data Quality Issues

- No observed CPC/CVR/AOV by channel yet.
- No observed return-rate distribution yet.
