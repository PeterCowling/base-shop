# Prime App Design Refresh Fact-Find Brief

## Scope

### Summary

Refresh the visual design of the Prime guest portal to better resonate with its actual user demographic: predominantly female (99%), overwhelmingly young (60% aged 18-25, 99% under 35), and traveling. Prime is a **mobile-only app** — guests access it on their phones during their hostel stay. The current design uses a functional teal/cyan palette with Geist Sans typography that reads as clean-but-corporate. The refresh should shift toward a warmer, more expressive, lifestyle-app aesthetic optimized entirely for mobile, without losing usability or accessibility.

### Goals

- Revise the Prime theme tokens (color palette, typography) to align with the target demographic
- Fix existing design inconsistencies (hardcoded Tailwind colors bypassing the token system)
- Establish a design policy document as a living reference for all BRIK customer-facing surfaces
- Maintain WCAG AA compliance and existing dark mode support
- Keep changes within the token/theme system (no component restructuring)

### Non-goals

- Restructuring page layouts or component architecture
- Adding new pages, features, or interactions
- Changing the design system infrastructure (`build-tokens.ts`, Tailwind config pipeline)
- Redesigning the owner/staff/admin views (internal-facing)
- Adding illustrations or photography (content, not code)

### Constraints & Assumptions

- Constraints:
  - All color changes must flow through the token pipeline (`packages/themes/prime/tokens.css` generated by `build-tokens.ts`)
  - WCAG AA contrast ratios must be maintained (base tokens enforce `--target-min-aa: 24px` tap targets, `--target-hig: 44px` HIG targets)
  - Dark mode must continue to work (all tokens have `-dark` variants)
  - No raw/hardcoded Tailwind colors — this refresh should also fix existing violations
  - The `@acme/design-system` component library is shared across apps; changes must be scoped to the Prime theme override layer
- Assumptions:
  - Geist Sans can be replaced in the Prime theme without affecting other apps (font is configured per-app via Next.js `next/font`)
  - The demographic data (99% female, 60% 18-25, 99% under 35) is accurate and stable
  - Prime is a mobile-only app (hostel guests access it on their phones) — no desktop/tablet breakpoints needed

## Evidence Audit (Current State)

### Entry Points

- `packages/themes/prime/tokens.css` — Prime-specific color overrides (23 lines, generated)
- `packages/themes/base/tokens.css` — Base token catalog (all semantic colors, typography, spacing, elevation)
- `apps/prime/src/styles/globals.css` — Imports theme tokens and Tailwind sources
- `apps/prime/src/app/layout.tsx` — Root layout, font loading (Geist Sans)
- `apps/prime/tailwind.config.mjs` — Tailwind config for Prime app

### Key Modules / Files

- `apps/prime/src/components/homepage/HomePage.tsx` — Main homepage, welcome text, section ordering
- `apps/prime/src/components/homepage/GuardedHomeExperience.tsx` — Authenticated layout wrapper (`bg-gray-50`, `max-w-md`)
- `apps/prime/src/components/quests/QuestCard.tsx` — Quest progress card (`bg-primary-soft`, progress bars)
- `apps/prime/src/components/homepage/cards/ServiceCard.tsx` — Service tiles (hover effects, links)
- `apps/prime/src/components/homepage/cards/TaskCard.tsx` — Task cards (completion states)
- `apps/prime/src/components/homepage/cards/SocialHighlightsCard.tsx` — Activity card (hardcoded emerald gradient)
- `apps/prime/src/components/homepage/ProfileCompletionBanner.tsx` — Profile banner (`bg-info-soft`, `border-primary`)

### Patterns & Conventions Observed

- **Token-driven theming**: Colors flow `packages/themes/prime/tokens.css` → CSS variables → Tailwind utilities. This is the correct change point — evidence: `packages/themes/base/tokens.css`, `packages/tailwind-config/src/index.ts`
- **Font loading via Next.js**: `next/font/google` or `next/font/local` in root layout — evidence: `apps/prime/src/app/layout.tsx`
- **Hardcoded color violations**: Multiple components use raw Tailwind colors instead of tokens:
  - `SocialHighlightsCard.tsx`: `from-emerald-50 to-teal-50`, `text-emerald-600`, `bg-emerald-500`
  - `HomePage.tsx`: `border-blue-500` (loading spinner), `text-red-600` (error)
  - `GuardedHomeExperience.tsx`: `bg-gray-50` (page background), `border-blue-500` (spinner)
  - `DoList.tsx`: `text-gray-800` (heading)
  - Various: `text-gray-900`, `text-gray-600` instead of `text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`

### Current Color Analysis

| Token | Current HSL | Visual | Assessment for Target Demo |
|-------|-------------|--------|---------------------------|
| Primary | `192° 80% 34%` | Deep teal/cyan | Reads as corporate/tech. Gender-neutral but cold. |
| Primary soft | `192° 70% 95%` | Very pale cyan | Fine as a tint but unexciting. |
| Accent | `32° 90% 55%` | Bright orange | Warm but more "utility/warning" than "lifestyle". |
| Accent soft | `32° 90% 95%` | Pale peach | Pleasant, closest to target aesthetic. |
| Hardcoded emerald | `emerald-50/500/600` | Green gradient | Social card uses this outside the token system. |

### Current Typography Analysis

| Property | Current Value | Assessment |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| Font family | Geist Sans | Geometric, developer-oriented. Clean but impersonal — reads as fintech/SaaS, not travel/lifestyle. |
| Heading weight | `font-bold` (700) | Appropriate |
| Body weight | `font-normal` (400) | Appropriate |
| Size scale | `xs` through `5xl` | Standard, no changes needed |

### Data & Contracts

- Types/schemas: No data model changes — this is a visual-only change
- Persistence: None affected
- API/event contracts: None affected

### Dependency & Impact Map

- Upstream dependencies:
  - `packages/themes/base/tokens.css` — inherited base tokens (not modified, only overridden)
  - `packages/themes/prime/tokens.css` — **primary change target**
  - `packages/tailwind-config/` — shared Tailwind preset (not modified)
  - `build-tokens.ts` — token generator script (may need modification if adding new font tokens)
- Downstream dependents:
  - All Prime app pages and components consume theme tokens
  - `@acme/design-system` components render with theme tokens (no library changes needed)
  - `@acme/ui` hospitality components use semantic tokens
- Likely blast radius:
  - **Contained**: Only `packages/themes/prime/tokens.css` and hardcoded-color fixes in `apps/prime/src/`
  - Font change touches `apps/prime/src/app/layout.tsx` (font import) and the Prime tokens file
  - No other apps are affected (brikette, business-os, reception each have their own theme)

### Test Landscape

#### Test Infrastructure

- **Frameworks:** Jest (unit), Playwright (E2E planned)
- **Commands:** `pnpm --filter prime test`, `pnpm typecheck`
- **CI integration:** Typecheck + lint run in CI; Jest tests for Prime exist but are limited
- **Coverage tools:** None with enforced thresholds for Prime specifically

#### Existing Test Coverage

| Area | Test Type | Files | Coverage Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Prime components | unit | Sparse — most components lack test files | Visual components are not snapshot-tested |
| Design tokens | build-time | `build-tokens.ts` validates token generation | Tokens themselves are generated, not hand-edited |
| Design system ESLint | lint | 33 rules in `@acme/eslint-plugin-ds` | Catches token violations at lint time |

#### Test Patterns & Conventions

- Visual changes are validated by manual review + ESLint design system rules
- No visual regression testing infrastructure (Chromatic, Percy, etc.)
- Token generation is tested by the build step (`build-tokens.ts` would fail on invalid input)

#### Coverage Gaps (Planning Inputs)

- **No snapshot tests** for Prime components — visual regressions detectable only by manual review
- **No visual regression CI** — color/font changes won't be caught by automated tests
- **ESLint rules will catch** if we introduce new hardcoded colors (positive)

#### Testability Assessment

- **Easy to test:** Token file generation (build step validates), ESLint rules catch violations
- **Hard to test:** Visual aesthetics, color harmony, contrast ratios (manual/tool-assisted)
- **Test seams needed:** None — changes are in CSS/config layer, not logic

#### Recommended Test Approach

- **Lint validation:** Run `pnpm lint` after token changes to confirm no new violations
- **Build validation:** Run Prime app build to confirm token generation succeeds
- **Manual visual review:** Before/after screenshots of key pages (home, find-my-stay, quest card)
- **Contrast check:** Use browser dev tools or axe to verify WCAG AA on new palette
- **Dark mode check:** Toggle dark mode and verify all pages remain readable

### Recent Git History (Targeted)

- `packages/themes/prime/tokens.css` — Last substantive change was initial creation; generated by build-tokens.ts
- Design system ESLint rules recently stabilized (33 rules active)

## Questions

### Resolved

- Q: Can the Prime theme be changed independently of other apps?
  - A: Yes. Each app has its own theme override in `packages/themes/<app>/tokens.css`. The base tokens provide defaults that are overridden per-app.
  - Evidence: `packages/themes/prime/tokens.css` overrides only primary/accent/font/radius. Other apps have their own override files.

- Q: How are fonts loaded?
  - A: Via Next.js `next/font` in the root layout. Each app controls its own font import. Changing Prime's font does not affect other apps.
  - Evidence: `apps/prime/src/app/layout.tsx`

- Q: Will hardcoded color fixes break anything?
  - A: No — replacing `text-gray-900` with `text-foreground` (etc.) makes the components respect the theme system. The visual output may shift slightly based on the new palette, which is the intent.
  - Evidence: Base tokens define `--color-fg: 0 0% 10%` which is equivalent to `gray-900` in Tailwind.

- Q: Is the demographic data already documented anywhere?
  - A: No. The BRIK intake packet (`docs/business-os/startup-baselines/BRIK-intake-packet.user.md`) describes the ICP as "Travelers booking hostel stays/experiences" (inferred) but does not include age/gender breakdown.
  - Evidence: BRIK intake packet section C.

- Q: What primary color direction?
  - A: **Warm coral/rose** (`~350-10°` hue range). Airbnb/Glossier aesthetic — warm, inviting, modern.
  - Decision: Pete, 2026-02-12

- Q: What font?
  - A: **Plus Jakarta Sans** (variable font). Friendly geometric, high x-height for mobile legibility, fast loading.
  - Decision: Pete, 2026-02-12

### Open (User Input Needed)

None — all decisions resolved.

## Confidence Inputs (for /lp-plan)

- **Implementation:** 90%
  - Token system is well-understood. Change points are clearly identified. The pipeline (`build-tokens.ts` → `tokens.css` → Tailwind) is proven. Hardcoded color locations are enumerated. Only gap: need to verify `build-tokens.ts` input format for any new tokens (e.g., font override).

- **Approach:** 95%
  - Token-level theming is the right approach. Color direction (warm coral/rose) and font (Plus Jakarta Sans) confirmed by owner. Only remaining uncertainty: exact HSL values for the coral palette and derived states.

- **Impact:** 95%
  - Blast radius is fully contained to Prime theme + hardcoded color fixes in `apps/prime/src/`. No other apps, packages, or data affected. Dark mode auto-derives from `-dark` token variants.

- **Delivery-Readiness:** 85%
  - Change points are identified. No external dependencies. Manual visual review is the quality gate (no automated visual regression). Delivery is straightforward once color/font decisions are made.

- **Testability:** 60%
  - No visual regression infrastructure. Validation is manual screenshots + contrast checking + ESLint. This is acceptable for a theme change but lower than a code-logic change. What would improve: visual regression CI (out of scope for this task).

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation / Open Question |
|------|-----------|--------|---------------------------|
| New palette fails WCAG AA contrast on some combinations | Medium | High | Run contrast checker on all primary/accent/background combinations before committing. Test both light and dark modes. |
| Hardcoded color fixes introduce subtle visual regressions | Low | Low | Replacing `text-gray-900` → `text-foreground` is semantically identical in the base theme. Visual diff will show any changes. |
| Font change affects text layout (line heights, truncation) | Low | Medium | Plus Jakarta Sans and DM Sans have similar metrics to Geist Sans. Test key pages for overflow/wrapping after font swap. |
| Exact coral HSL values need tuning | Low | Low | Start with a well-known coral palette (e.g., `~8° 80% 60%`), verify contrast, adjust during visual review. |

## Planning Constraints & Notes

- Must-follow patterns:
  - All colors via theme tokens, never hardcoded Tailwind classes
  - Font loaded via `next/font` in `apps/prime/src/app/layout.tsx`
  - Dark mode variants must be provided for every light-mode token
  - Design system ESLint rules must pass (`pnpm lint`)
  - **Mobile-only**: design exclusively for phone viewports. No desktop/tablet responsive layouts needed. Optimize for thumb-zone reachability, one-handed use, and handheld viewing distance.
- Rollout/rollback expectations:
  - Single deployment — all token changes apply atomically
  - Rollback: revert the tokens.css and layout.tsx changes (one commit)
- Observability expectations:
  - Manual visual review of key screens: home, find-my-stay, quest card, service cards, check-in QR

## Suggested Task Seeds (Non-binding)

1. **Update Prime theme tokens** — Set coral/rose primary HSL values and warm accent in `packages/themes/prime/tokens.css` (or its source input to `build-tokens.ts`)
2. **Update font import** — Change `apps/prime/src/app/layout.tsx` to load Plus Jakarta Sans (variable)
3. **Fix hardcoded color violations** — Replace all raw Tailwind color classes in `apps/prime/src/components/` with semantic token classes (`text-foreground`, `bg-primary`, `border-primary`, etc.)
4. **Verify dark mode** — Test all pages in dark mode and adjust `-dark` token variants if needed
5. **Verify accessibility** — Run contrast check on new palette, confirm WCAG AA compliance
6. **Visual review** — Screenshot key pages before/after for comparison

## Execution Routing Packet

- Primary execution skill: `/lp-build`
- Supporting skills: `/lp-design-system`
- Deliverable acceptance package:
