# Product Naming — HEAD (ASSESSMENT-13)

## A) Brand-Product Name Relationship

**Pattern chosen:** compound

**Rationale:** Facilella is a coined Italian-register masterbrand with deliberate expansion headroom — it names the brand, not the product category. The product naming pattern "Facilella [Line Name]" follows established Italian lifestyle-accessories conventions (Furla Metropolis, Furla Candy; Marni Trunk; etc.), keeps the brand name prominent in all retail touchpoints, and makes future SKU extension straightforward without a separate naming exercise per product. The brand carries lifestyle trust equity; the product-line name signals variant, form factor, or use-case.

**Business name:** Facilella
**Product name will:** extend the business name as a compound. Each product line is marketed as "Facilella [Line Name]" across product detail pages, packaging, and marketplace listings.

## B) Product Name Candidates

*Note (2026-02-26): A systematic product naming pipeline has been run (see `docs/business-os/strategy/HEAD/product-naming-shortlist-2026-02-26.user.md`). 72 candidates were generated across 5 territories with DWPEIC scoring (max 30). The top 20 candidates have been processed through TM pre-screen direction. The 5 seeds below have been scored in the pipeline and their shortlist ranking is noted. The operator should review the shortlist artifact and confirm a selection there.*

| # | Candidate Name | Full Compound | Pattern | Rationale | Risks | Pipeline Score | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Cerchietto** | Facilella Cerchietto | Compound | Natural Italian word for headband (cerchietto = small ring/hoop). Warm diminutive ending matches the brand's -ella register. Immediately legible to Italian ICP without translation friction. Signals product category clearly on every PDP and Etsy listing. | Describes the category generically — brand equity must carry differentiation. Not distinctive as a standalone mark. | 25/30 — shortlist rank #7; feminised form Cerchietta at #3 (27/30) | shortlisted |
| 2 | **Sicura** | Facilella Sicura | Compound | Means "safe / secure" in Italian (feminine form). Leads with the core benefit signal ("Secure wear for busy days"). Directly legible to ICP-A (caregiver) with no explanation needed. Short, memorable, compatible with Italian copy register. | Slightly benefit-functional — risks reading as safety-coded rather than lifestyle-coded. Works best paired with warm brand language; weak in isolation. | 25/30 — not in top 20 (coined form Sicella 26/30 outranks it) | reviewed |
| 3 | **Libera** | Facilella Libera | Coined standalone | Means "free" in Italian (feminine form). Positions the headband around child agency, freedom of movement, and normalised wearing — all core brand territory. Compatible with secondary ICP (active teen/adult wearers). Avoids clinical framing entirely. | Freedom framing skews aspirational; functional "will this stay on?" buyers may not immediately understand the product category. Less legible as a search term on Etsy/Google. | 23/30 — not in top 20 | reviewed |
| 4 | **Everyday** | Facilella Everyday | Standalone descriptor | English loan word, internationally legible, low translation overhead for EU expansion beyond Italy. Directly echoes key phrase "Made for everyday wear" in the brand voice brief. Clean on PDP, packaging, and social. | English in an Italian-primary brand risks minor register mismatch. "Everyday" is not trademarkable on its own — the Facilella compound is the protectable element. Common word; distinctiveness depends entirely on the brand prefix. | 22/30 — not in top 20 | reviewed |
| 5 | **Sport** | Facilella Sport | Standalone descriptor | Simple, internationally legible variant name for active-use form factors. Easy to differentiate from the everyday variant at SKU level. Strong on Etsy and DTC: "Facilella Sport headband" reads naturally as a search-friendly product title. | Narrow framing — "Sport" signals the active-use variant only. Not suitable as the hero name for the everyday retention headband. Best used as a line extension name after the core range is established. | 22/30 — not in top 20; correct as line extension name, not hero | reviewed |

**Operator selected:** {TBD — see `docs/business-os/strategy/HEAD/product-naming-shortlist-2026-02-26.user.md` for full shortlist and TM direction}

**Pipeline shortlist top 5 for operator consideration:**
1. Archella (28/30) — `Facilella Archella` — coined headband form, high category signal, high ICP resonance
2. Nastella (28/30) — `Facilella Nastella` — coined ribbon/band form, high category signal
3. Sicella (26/30) — `Facilella Sicella` — coined from "sicura" (safe), benefit-territory, high ICP resonance
4. Svelta (26/30) — `Facilella Svelta` — Italian adjective (quick/nimble), warm and lifestyle-positive
5. Sempre (26/30) — `Facilella Sempre` — "always", normalises daily wear powerfully, high E score

## C) TM Pre-Screen Direction

The candidate names above have not been checked against trademark registers. Before finalising, the operator should:

1. Search the relevant national/regional trademark register(s) for each candidate name in the applicable product category classes:
   - **EUIPO eTMview** (covers all EU member states) — euipo.europa.eu/eSearch
   - **WIPO Global Brand Database** (cross-jurisdictional) — branddb.wipo.int
   - **UIBM** (Italian national register) — uibm.gov.it *(Italian-first market — run this in addition to EUIPO)*

2. Search for exact-match and phonetic-near-match results for each candidate name in the target classes.

3. A clear result in the target class does not guarantee no conflict — seek IP advice if any near-matches are found.

**Recommended classes:**
- **Class 25** — Clothing, footwear, headgear (covers textile headbands as headwear/apparel accessories)
- **Class 26** — Lace and embroidery, ribbons and braid, hair slides, hair grips, hair accessories (covers headbands as hair accessories specifically)

*Note: Italian MDR regulatory context means product marketing claims must remain non-medical. A TM in Class 10 (medical/surgical instruments) is neither required nor appropriate for this positioning.*

**TM pre-screen status:** Direction generated (2026-02-26) — operator search not yet completed. See `product-naming-tm-2026-02-26.txt` for search URLs for all 20 shortlist candidates.

## D) Naming Convention for Future SKUs

**Convention:** `Facilella [Line Name]` — where Line Name is a 1–2 word Italian or Italian-accessible English descriptor signalling use-case, form factor, or bundle composition. Line Names should be pronounceable in Italian and feel natural in Italian copy.

**Examples:**

| SKU | Full Name | Line Name rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Hero retention headband | Facilella Cerchietto | Standard everyday form factor — Italian product-category term |
| Active/sport variant | Facilella Sport | English loan word; clean differentiation for active-use ICP segment |
| School multi-pack | Facilella School Kit | English descriptors; school context is internationally legible and ICP-direct |
| Organiser pouch | Facilella Borsa | Borsa = bag/pouch in Italian; keeps the naming in Italian register |
| Patch packs | Facilella Patch | English loan word widely used in Italian product context |

**Multi-product handling:** The compound convention extends naturally across the full 90-day extension range (pouch, patch packs) and any future headband variants (e.g., Facilella Lino for a linen fabric line). If the brand expands beyond CI accessories into a substantially different product category (e.g., clothing, digital tools), a separate naming exercise is recommended — the compound pattern keeps each category coherent, but a new Line Name family should be agreed before that category launches.
