# MARKET-05 Synthesis Prompt — Caryina (HBAG) Assumptions and Risk Register

## Context for the research agent

**Business:** Caryina — premium artisan bag accessories brand, Positano, Italy.
**Products:** H1 bag charm (€99 Etsy launch price), H2 AirPods holder (€89 Etsy launch price).
**Stage:** This is a synthesis stage — the research agent's job is to read MARKET-01 through MARKET-04 and produce a consolidated assumptions and risk register. No new primary research is required; the agent should reason from existing evidence.

**This is not a research task. It is a structured synthesis and risk reasoning task.**

---

## Consolidated findings from MARKET-01 through MARKET-04

Read these before producing any output. Do not re-derive; synthesise from them.

### From MARKET-01 (Competitor mapping)
- Premium mini handbag-silhouette charms are a gap on Etsy at €80–€150; the space is dominated by bag jewellery (pearls/chains) and leather tech cases — not handbag-silhouette charms.
- Closest shape competitors: SexylittleVintage ($79), YLSecretHeart ($76.88), TyransLeatherShop ($72–$89). All below Caryina's target.
- Biggest H2 threat: PEGAI ($99, 107k Etsy sales) — but US-only shipping, leaving an EU gap.
- Cheap lookalikes (sub-$30 mini Birkin charms) exist with hundreds of reviews; price anchoring is a real category risk.

### From MARKET-02 (Demand evidence)
- Bag charm trend is active but maturing — shifting from novelty/character to craft/texture-led, "refined" executions. Trend runway estimated 12–24 months from intake.
- Etsy shows active buyer intent signals (favourites, "in carts", "low stock") on charm-adjacent listings.
- AirPods case category commoditised on Etsy (3,000+ items, most <$50).
- Apple AirPods Pro 3 released Sep 2025 — Q1 2026 may be tail of the new-device accessory wave.
- Buyer qualitative pull: Reddit confirms Etsy as active search destination; buyers warn about reseller noise; some buyers pay above MSRP for desired premium SKUs (secondary market willingness-to-pay signal).
- Gap flags: exact Google Trends values for Q1 2026 not available; TikTok/Instagram primary hashtag volumes not captured.

### From MARKET-03 (Pricing benchmarks)
- H1 Etsy launch price: €99 (Medium confidence). Volume cliff is at ~$79–$80; above $100 conversion is viable but skews "art object" with lower review density and higher favourites.
- H2 Etsy launch price: €89 (Medium–Low confidence). Etsy AirPods case buyers are price-conditioned ($20–$50 with massive review volumes); €89 only holds if framed as fashion object not tech cover.
- Amalfi tourist channel range: €110–€140 H1 / €90–€120 H2 (Medium–Low confidence).
- "Italian leather" + "brass" claims are commoditised on Etsy — photography and craft proof are the true differentiators.
- Discounting is dominant in adjacent Etsy categories; if Caryina does not discount, photography/craft credibility must compensate.
- Shipping must be baked into list price to show "free shipping" — material for US buyer conversion.
- Italy fee stack: 6.5% transaction + 4% + €0.30 payment processing + 0.32% Regulatory Operating fee. On a €99 order, ~10.82% in platform fees before shipping, VAT, and product cost.

### From MARKET-04 (Channel landscape)
- 90-day channel stack: Etsy Day 1 (primary), TikTok + Instagram organic Day 1 (discovery), Pinterest Day 30 (evergreen support). Tourist channel seasonal June–Sept parallel.
- US de minimis suspension (executive order 20 Feb 2026): duties collected by CBP on all international postal shipments to the US. Creates buyer friction (delays, surprise charges) that must be addressed in listing copy and carrier choice.
- Etsy onboarding for Italy-based sellers has three sequential gates: identity verification, bank payout, EU tax/VAT compliance. These can delay launch.
- Free shipping conversion uplift on Etsy for US buyers (Etsy cites 20% more likely to complete purchase).
- Etsy Offsite Ads: 15% fee for shops <$10k sales — will apply from day 1. Cannot be opted out of for qualifying shops.
- Poste Italiane International Standard: from €25.80, 10–25 days non-EU. Express: from €35–39, 3 working days.
- TikTok Shop Italy available since Mar 2025 but operationally heavier; hold for Phase 2 after Etsy traction.
- MARKET-04 confidence scoring note: typical Positano consignment split (40–60% store share) is Low–Medium confidence — not Italy-specific data.

## Synthesis task

Produce a structured assumptions and risk register that Caryina's operator can use to:
1. Decide whether the offer is ready to finalise and test (MARKET-06 check)
2. Know which assumptions are most dangerous and must be tracked during the 90-day test
3. Identify any blockers that should be resolved before listing launch
4. Have a clear record of what would change the offer or channel strategy if proven wrong

## Required Output Sections

### Section 1 — Top Assumptions

For each assumption, provide:
- **Statement:** the specific belief being assumed
- **Dependency:** which decision or action depends on this assumption being true
- **Source:** which MARKET stage surfaced or established this (01–04)
- **Confidence:** High / Medium / Low / Gap
- **Kill test:** what observable evidence in the first 30 days would falsify this assumption?

Cover at minimum the following assumption categories:

**A — Demand and category assumptions:**
- The bag charm trend has sufficient runway in 2026 to support a new Etsy entrant at premium pricing
- There is unmet buyer demand specifically for a handbag-silhouette micro-bag charm at €99 (i.e., this is not just a gap because no one wants it)
- The H1 handbag-silhouette format is distinctive enough on Etsy to resist sub-$30 anchor price compression

**B — Price assumptions:**
- €99 (H1) and €89 (H2) will convert on Etsy within 28 days of launch with adequate listing quality
- The Amalfi in-destination price premium (€110–€140 H1) is achievable given Positano boutique context

**C — Channel assumptions:**
- Etsy organic will generate enough impressions during the recency window to enable a meaningful 28-day demand test
- TikTok/Instagram organic content will generate discoverable Etsy search lift within 30 days
- US buyers will convert despite the de minimis duty suspension (or EU/UK buyers provide an adequate alternative market)

**D — Operational assumptions:**
- The Etsy shop can be fully verified and compliant (Italy seller gates: identity, bank, VAT) in time for a planned launch date
- Shipping from Italy can be priced into the listing (absorbed into "free shipping") and still maintain a viable unit margin at €99

**E — Product assumptions:**
- Photography and craft-proof assets can be produced to a quality that "reads €99" to a cold Etsy browser
- The mini-handbag silhouette (H1) and AirPod holder (H2) are functionally viable as described in the intake packet (attachment mechanism, hardware, size)

### Section 2 — Risk Register

For each risk, provide:
- **Risk statement**
- **Impact:** if this risk materialises, what is the operational consequence? (scale: Low / Medium / High)
- **Likelihood:** how probable is this in the 90-day test window? (Low / Medium / High)
- **Source MARKET stage**
- **Mitigation:** specific action Caryina can take to reduce this risk before or during the test
- **Blocking?** Yes (blocks launch) / No (manageable during test)

Cover at minimum these risk categories:

**Category R-1 — Category / demand risks:**
- R-1a: Bag charm trend enters faster decline than forecast — reduces total addressable demand before validation can complete
- R-1b: Sub-$30 mini Birkin charm lookalikes prevent price discovery — buyers assume €99 is a mistake or overpriced

**Category R-2 — Pricing / conversion risks:**
- R-2a: €99 H1 doesn't convert within 28 days — insufficient to declare demand validated (≥3 paid orders per falsifiable form)
- R-2b: €89 H2 doesn't convert without discounting — H2 is more price-sensitive than assumed
- R-2c: Etsy Offsite Ads fee (15%) eats margin before shop reaches $10k — reduces unit economics below viable threshold

**Category R-3 — Channel / operational risks:**
- R-3a: US de minimis duties create surprise charges and buyer complaints — triggers negative reviews on a new shop with no review buffer
- R-3b: Etsy Italy seller onboarding gate (identity/bank/VAT) delays launch by 2–4 weeks
- R-3c: Shipping cost makes "free shipping" economically unviable at €99, forcing visible postage that reduces US conversion
- R-3d: TikTok/Instagram content cadence is not sustained — social discovery channel goes dark mid-test

**Category R-4 — Product / photography risks:**
- R-4a: Photography does not reach "reads €99" threshold — buyer perception test (TASK-06 in intake) not yet confirmed
- R-4b: Hardware or attachment mechanism is not durable / functional in practice — returns spike on first few orders

**Category R-5 — External / macro risks:**
- R-5a: Etsy algorithm update during test window changes new-shop visibility dynamics
- R-5b: TikTok regulatory disruption (potential US/EU regulatory action) removes key discovery channel mid-test

### Section 3 — Evidence Conflicts and Required Resolution Artifacts

List any cases where MARKET-01 through MARKET-04 evidence is in tension or where the evidence is insufficient to make a confident decision. For each conflict:
- **Conflict statement:** what the tension is
- **Stage sources in conflict:** which MARKET stages produced the conflicting signals
- **Required resolution:** what observation or artifact would resolve the conflict
- **Decision impact:** what decision is blocked or uncertain until resolved

Key conflicts to explicitly address:
- H2 pricing: MARKET-03 recommends €89 but with Medium–Low confidence given Etsy AirPods case commoditisation. What would "resolve" the H2 price confidence gap?
- Demand evidence gaps (from MARKET-02): exact Google Trends values, TikTok hashtag volumes, and Etsy autocomplete vocabulary were not captured. Do these gaps materially change any offer or channel decision, or are they tolerable at this stage?
- Consignment terms in Positano: MARKET-04 consignment split (40–60%) is Low–Medium confidence. Does this uncertainty block the tourist channel or can it be assumed acceptable?
- Photography proof: TASK-06 (photography perception test) in the intake packet is flagged Critical but is not yet complete. Is this a blocker for the Etsy launch?

### Section 4 — Decision-Critical Unknowns to Resolve Before Offer Finalisation

Distinguish:
- **Blocking unknowns:** must be resolved before listing launch (without this, the test is invalid or unlaunchable)
- **Non-blocking unknowns:** can be resolved during or after the test

For each unknown:
- **Unknown:** what is not yet known
- **Blocking?** Yes / No
- **Resolution path:** how to get the answer (specific action, not generic "research this")
- **Deadline:** before launch / by Day 30 / by Day 60 / post-test

### Section 5 — Ready-for-Offer Checklist

A binary go/no-go checklist confirming whether MARKET-01 through MARKET-04 have collectively produced enough intelligence for MARKET-06 (offer design) to proceed.

For each item, mark: ✅ Complete / ⚠️ Gap (non-blocking) / ❌ Blocker

| Check | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Competitor set mapped with pricing and review evidence | — | — |
| Demand evidence for primary ICP (women 27–42, aspirational handbag owners) is sufficient to support offer hypothesis | — | — |
| Price hypothesis is validated to Medium confidence or better for at least H1 | — | — |
| Price hypothesis for H2 is understood with explicit confidence tag | — | — |
| Primary channel (Etsy) is operationally feasible for Italy-based seller | — | — |
| Discovery channels (TikTok/Instagram) are identified and executable | — | — |
| Key risks are documented and mitigations identified | — | — |
| Blocking unknowns are listed with resolution paths | — | — |
| Falsifiable success criterion (≥3 paid orders in 28 days) is aligned with evidence base | — | — |

If any item is marked ❌ Blocker, state clearly what must be resolved before MARKET-06 can proceed. If all items are ✅ or ⚠️, confirm MARKET-05 is complete and MARKET-06 is unblocked.

## Scope Constraints

- This is a synthesis document. Every claim must trace to MARKET-01, MARKET-02, MARKET-03, or MARKET-04 — or be explicitly flagged as a new inference with reasoning.
- Do NOT add new primary market data (no new web research required or expected).
- Do NOT re-state findings from MARKET-01–04 at length. Summarise with references.
- Assumptions and risks should be actionable: each must have a concrete kill test or mitigation, not generic "monitor this."
