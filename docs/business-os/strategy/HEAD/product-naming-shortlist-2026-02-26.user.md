## B) Curator's Analysis — Top Candidates by Territory

### Italian Product-Type (Ranks 1–7, 14)

The product-type territory produced the two highest-scoring candidates overall. **Archella** and **Nastella** score 28/30 — the compound feminised diminutive form (arch + ella, nastr + ella) creates natural phonetic continuity with the Facilella masterbrand. Both are strong wordmarks and highly legible as category signals (C=5). **Archella** is particularly strong because "archetto" (the headband form factor) is the Italian consumer word for hairband — "Facilella Archella" immediately communicates the product before the photo loads.

**Cerchietta** (seed candidate, feminised) scores 27/30. **Archetto** and **Cerchietto** (the original un-feminised seeds) score 25/30 with lower D scores — they are real Italian nouns with wider exposure. **Faschella** and **Nastrica** score 27/30 — both coined from the band/ribbon vocabulary, strong category signal.

**Recommendation:** Archella is the strongest product-type candidate. Nastella is the strongest if the operator prefers a ribbon/band imagery over a hoop/arch imagery. Cerchietta is the clearest category signal but lower distinctiveness.

### Italian Benefit (Ranks 8–13)

Six benefit-territory candidates all score 26/30 with I=5 — the highest ICP resonance across all territories. **Sicella** (from sicura, safe/secure), **Fermella** (from ferma, firm), **Saldella** (from salda, steady), **Pronella** (from pronta, ready), **Decella** (from decisa, decisive), and **Vivella** (from viva, alive) are all coined fragment-blend forms. They score D=5 (high distinctiveness as coined words), low C (C=2 — category not obvious without an image), but very high I=5 (Italian caregiver on mobile would immediately associate with the lifestyle-accessories-for-CI-use context).

**Recommendation:** Sicella leads this group — "sicura" (safe/secure) is the most emotionally salient benefit word for the ICP (parent's core question: "will it stay on?"). Vivella and Fermella are strong alternatives.

### Italian Routine (Ranks 15, 18–20)

**Sempre** (always) scores 26/30 with I=5 — the word "sempre" normalises daily, habitual wearing powerfully. It is the only T3 candidate in the shortlist top 20 that scores I=5; it functions as a meta-claim about routine rather than naming a time of day. **Certova**, **Abitella**, and **Prestella** (coined routine-blend forms) score 26/30 with I=4, E=4–5.

**Recommendation:** Sempre is the strongest standalone routine word. Abitella (from abitudine, habit) has the best E score (5 — works across all product variants including future non-headband accessories) if the operator wants a name that scales.

### Coined Diminutive (Ranks 16–17)

**Svelta** (nimble, quick) and **Destella** (from desta, alert/awake) score 26/30. Both are warm and lifestyle-positive — they pass all spa/wellness tests and score I=5. Svelta is a real Italian adjective; Destella is a coined blend.

**Recommendation:** Svelta is the most immediately warm of the coined forms — it conveys both quickness (product goes on quickly) and nimbleness (child moves freely).

## C) Operator Selection

**Instructions:** Review the TM pre-screen links in `product-naming-tm-2026-02-26.txt` before confirming a selection. Record TM results in Section A's TM Pre-Screen Status column, then confirm below.

**Operator selected:** {TBD — to be confirmed by operator after TM pre-screen review}

**Selection rationale:** {To be filled by operator}

**Next step after selection:** Update `docs/business-os/strategy/HEAD/2026-02-26-product-naming.user.md` Section B — change selected candidate status from `provisional` to `confirmed` and mark others `reviewed`. Then run `/lp-do-assessment-14-logo-brief --business HEAD` to produce the logo design brief.

## D) Shortlisted ASSESSMENT-13 Seeds (Reference)

The 5 original ASSESSMENT-13 provisional candidates were scored in the generation run:

| Seed | Score | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Cerchietto | 25/30 | In shortlist as #7 (and feminised form Cerchietta at #3) |
| Sicura | 25/30 | Not in top 20 (Sicella 26/30 outranks it) — see full candidate table |
| Libera | 23/30 | Not in top 20 — scroll-test I=4, benefit territory, lower D |
| Everyday | 22/30 | Not in top 20 — English-primary, W=5 but slightly foreign for Italian ICP |
| Sport | 22/30 | Not in top 20 — E=2 (narrow to sport variant), correct as a line extension name not the hero |

## E) TM Pre-Screen Direction Reference

Full TM direction output (EUIPO, WIPO GBD, UIBM search URLs for all 20 candidates):
`docs/business-os/strategy/HEAD/product-naming-tm-2026-02-26.txt`
