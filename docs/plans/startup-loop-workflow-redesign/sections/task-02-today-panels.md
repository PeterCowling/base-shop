### HEAD

**Current blocker:** Operational confirmations are missing — in-stock date, sellable units, pricing, compatibility, payment flow readiness, and returns SLA have not been confirmed. Measure stage is also not yet in place.

**Do this now:** Fill in the Operational Confirmations form for HEAD (all 6 fields). Then complete the Pre-website Measure checklist.

**Done when:** All 6 operational fields are confirmed and timestamped. Measure stage document is at Active status.

### PET

**Current blocker:** Inventory reality is unconfirmed (units, arrival date, landed cost). No measured CPC or CVR data yet — the forecast cannot reach decision-grade without these inputs.

**Do this now:** Confirm inventory units, expected arrival date, and landed cost per unit. Then run a 7-day paid acquisition test to capture the first observed CPC and CVR.

**Done when:** Inventory confirmed. First measured CPC and CVR captured. Forecast upgraded to decision-grade.

### BRIK

**Current blocker:** GA4 measurement signal quality is unverified. The begin_checkout and web_vitals events have not been confirmed in standard GA4 reports (non-realtime, 7-day window).

**Do this now:** Open GA4 Standard Reports (NOT Realtime). Check begin_checkout for the last 7 days. Check web_vitals for the last 7 days. Document what you find.

**Done when:** Non-zero signal confirmed in standard 7-day GA4 report for both begin_checkout and web_vitals. Then run the day-14 forecast recalibration.
