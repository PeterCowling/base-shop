# @acme/platform-core

Core APIs and domain logic for the Acme commerce platform. It centralizes cart mechanics, product data, orders, shipping, analytics, theming and more.

## Core APIs

- **db** – Prisma client for PostgreSQL access.
- **createShop** – scaffold utilities and provider discovery.
- **cart**, **cartStore**, **cartCookie** – server and client helpers for cart persistence.
- **orders** and **shipping** – order lifecycle and shipping labels.
- **analytics** – event collection helpers.
- **products**, **shops**, **themeTokens** – domain modules for catalog and theming.
- **plugins** – integration points for payment and shipping providers.
- **utils**, **repositories**, **hooks**, and React contexts for common client features.

Each module is exposed via subpath exports:

```ts
import { cartStore } from "@acme/platform-core/cartStore";
```
